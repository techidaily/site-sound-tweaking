## Perfected Acoustic Parameters for Electronics Optimization

When you use your device for listening to music, default audio profile of your device is just not good enough. This is because a default audio profile makes almost all types of music sound similar and you will never get to listen to the variations they have. That is where an equalizer comes into the scene. An equalizer is basically an audio filter or profile that has a certain setting for the frequencies of sound so that the music you are playing on your device sounds as good as originally recorded.

Whether you listen to music on your smartphone or your computer through speakers or headphones, an equalizer app is a necessity especially if you are an audiophile. That is why we have picked the best sound equalizer apps both for smartphones and computers where there are several music equalizer settings available to choose from.

Yes, from the options provided, you can slide the parameters like pitch, equalizer, ducking, and denoise if required to modify the keyframe.

Yes, in the upcoming session, we can see how to **fade audio with keyframes**, but here let’s look at the other options.

**Step 2**: **Change Soundwaves**

**Step 3**: **Remove Background Noise**

To remove unwanted background noise, you can tick the “**Remove Background Noise**” checkbox that will offer you three options: **Weak, Mild,** and **Strong**.

**Step 4**: **Edit the Volume**

If you want to lower the volume of other clips in the video, you can use the “**Lower the volume of other clips**” checkbox next to the ducking option.

It’s not just one, but Filmora offers five attractive choices to modify the created **audio keyframe**.

## Part 3: How to Fade In/Out Audio with Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Now that you are familiar with the method to add **Filmora keyframes** for audio and modifying them, here is a particular part of how you can **fade audio with keyframes**.
