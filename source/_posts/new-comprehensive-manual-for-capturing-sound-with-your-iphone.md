You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

### Method 2

If you have installed the application using the PPA, you may remove it by performing the instructions shown below.

\>**Step** 1:

The first step is to

This indicates that the add-apt-repository command was used to add the PPA to your system. You may also use the same command to uninstall the PPA from your computer. Simply include the —remove option in your command.

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

Thus, PPA-purge enters the scene to help solve the problem. The PPA is disabled, but all of the apps installed by the PPA are also uninstalled, or they are reverted to the original versions given by your distribution.

Install the PPA-purge package and remove the Audacity package may be accomplished by running the following command.
