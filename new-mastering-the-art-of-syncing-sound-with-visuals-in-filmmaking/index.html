<p>Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:</p>
