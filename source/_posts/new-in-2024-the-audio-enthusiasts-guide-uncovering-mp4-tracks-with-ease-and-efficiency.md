### Conclusion

Each audio ducking software in this article proved their expertise. Adobe Premium Pro is good-to-go for Photoshop for professional video editing, KineMaster, a friendly handy mobile application, and LumaFusion, apt for filmmakers & journalists. However, if you are new to video edit, Filmora will be the best choice for you with all the above features in one tool. Also, we found that Filmora from Wondershare, our recommendation surpasses all others, making it the smartest pick as best audio ducking software.
