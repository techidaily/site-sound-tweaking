Unlike Mac, Windows makes it simple to capture audio from a movie or media file running on your desktop. There seem to be two primary methods for accomplishing audacity record desktop audio in this way:

There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.
