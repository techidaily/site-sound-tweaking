* [Part2. What to Look for in Audio Editing Software](#part2)
* [Part3\. Three Audio Editor Software Mac Selections](#part3)

This means that most of the work is simply recording or adding new tracks, making basic edits, and putting in certain sound effects, which often augments or changes the vocal track.

## Part2. What to Look for in Audio Editing Software

For consumers looking to obtain the right audio editor for their Mac, several considerations need to be taken into account, starting with their particular demands.

* **Simple or Full Featured:** In essence, do you need a full-featured editing software similar to what professionals use, or do you just need something that can record, edit, and then share clean audio? For example, if you are running a podcast, then the software itself can be quite simple in its features. formats.
* **Compatibility:** You’ll want the software to be compatible with the format you are recording or obtaining the tracks. For the most part, audio editing software is quite adaptable, but certain types of tracks may not be compatible. So, check it out before you make your choice.
* **Sharing Capacity: The editing software must output** in a format that can be shared easily. So, you will want to look for systems compatible with what you are using.

## Part3. Three Audio Editor Software Mac Selections

What follows are three audio editing software solutions for the Mac which are relatively inexpensive but meet the needs of most consumer and small business operations.

### **_[Wondershare Filmora Audio Editor for Mac:](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)_**

### Audio Editor: [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) (Free)

This editor handles uncompressed audio and supports many files, including AIFF, .WAV, MP2/3.FLAC and .OGG. You can record from different inputs, employ the JACK Audio feature, monitor the volume, and add several different effects.

The good news is that this editing software is simple, straightforward, and will work for many consumers who create their own broadcasts. However, it is rather limited when recording audio from your computer itself, and you’ll need to add SoundFlower to accomplish that.

![audacity audio editor mac ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity.jpg)

### Audio Editor:[WavePad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/) ($50)

This is one of the more celebrated audio editing software systems for Mac computers. It contains many tools and sound effects and supports a considerable number of file types. The main attribute may be how user-friendly the wavepad sound editor is and the number of different features.

The only substantial negative is that the floating toolbars used will get in the way when you are working on larger projects. However, a big positive is that this editing system can clean up old, hissy audio quite well, substantially improving your recordings.
