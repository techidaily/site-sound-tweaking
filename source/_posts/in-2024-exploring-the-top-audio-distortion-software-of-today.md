<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Wondershare Filmora for Mac?

Is adding an **audio keyframe** in Wondershare Filmora for Mac easy? Else is the interface too tough to follow? Keep your confusion aside and take a look at the below step-by-step guide on how to perform **audio keyframing** in Wondershare Filmora for Mac.

**Step 1**: **Launch to** **Add Media Files**

Launch or open the Wondershare Filmora on your Mac. Then, add a media file or the video file into the work panel by dragging-dropping the file into the timeline.

You can also execute “**File > Import Media > Import media files**” to bring the files into the timeline.

**Step 2**: **Edit Audio**

Once your video reaches the timeline, double-clicking on it will take you to the editing menu to choose the “**Audio**” tab.

Increase or decrease the volume level based on which the clips should play.

**Step 3**: **Adjust Volume and Add Keyframe**

Place the pointer on the timeline where you want to add an **audio keyframe.** Then double-click the audio clip that will again redirect you to the Audio panel.

Now, click on the keyframe icon on the left side panel, make the volume adjustment on the timeline by dragging the volume envelope, and tapping the “OK” button.

To add the second **audio keyframe**, move the playhead to the desired spot, and once done, perform step 3 again.

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Not only adding an **audio keyframe** is possible in Wondershare Filmora for Mac, but modifying or **adjust the audio** keyframe is possible as well.

**Step 1**: **Modify Audio Keyframe**

The easy option of modifying the **audio keyframe** is from the Audio panel that will navigate by double-clicking on the **audio keyframe** created on the timeline.

Yes, from the options provided, you can slide the parameters like pitch, equalizer, ducking, and denoise if required to modify the keyframe.

Yes, in the upcoming session, we can see how to **fade audio with keyframes**, but here let’s look at the other options.

**Step 2**: **Change Soundwaves**

Audio is a mix up of speech, music, etc. Changing the sound waves would bring out a different keyframe. To do so, you can tap on the inverted triangle next to the **Equalizer** option that will offer you various options like **classic, dance, soft, techno**, and a lot more.

**Step 3**: **Remove Background Noise**

To remove unwanted background noise, you can tick the “**Remove Background Noise**” checkbox that will offer you three options: **Weak, Mild,** and **Strong**.

**Step 4**: **Edit the Volume**

If you want to lower the volume of other clips in the video, you can use the “**Lower the volume of other clips**” checkbox next to the ducking option.

It’s not just one, but Filmora offers five attractive choices to modify the created **audio keyframe**.

## Part 3: How to Fade In/Out Audio with Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Now that you are familiar with the method to add **Filmora keyframes** for audio and modifying them, here is a particular part of how you can **fade audio with keyframes**. As it is a special effect with audio keyframe, we have framed a special session with the two methods offered by Wondershare Filmora for Mac.

**Method 1**

**Step 1**: Once you created the **audio keyframe** or double-clicked the video spot where you want to make the keyframe, you will land on the audio panel like the below interface.

**Step 2**: To **fade audio in** keyframe once accessing the audio settings, drag or slide the pointer on the “**Fadein**” option to the right to set the duration.

**Step 3**: To **fade audio out**, you can use the slider next to the “**Fadeout**” option to set the duration.

**Method 2**

* You can directly apply the fade in/out in the **audio keyframe** on the timeline. Once you place the video, the audio track will appear where you can see the icon - the **Fade** option above the audio waveform.
* Dragging the **fade audio in the** handle at the beginning of the clip will impose the effect and set its duration automatically. Pulling the **fade audio out** handle at the end of the clip will impose the fade-out effect.

## Conclusion

No doubt, Wondershare Filmora is the best choice to carry over your **audio keyframing** process. You can customize your creations as per your requirement or need, and Filmora comes in handy as well. Along with practical interpretation on adding an **audio keyframe** and fading audio with keywords, I hope we have resolved the need for an external guide to proceed with the editing process. It’s not just with the process of keyframing, but Wondershare Filmora can do wonders to your design, and so, with no delay, try it out today for free!

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Not only adding an **audio keyframe** is possible in Wondershare Filmora for Mac, but modifying or **adjust the audio** keyframe is possible as well.

**Step 1**: **Modify Audio Keyframe**

The easy option of modifying the **audio keyframe** is from the Audio panel that will navigate by double-clicking on the **audio keyframe** created on the timeline.

Yes, from the options provided, you can slide the parameters like pitch, equalizer, ducking, and denoise if required to modify the keyframe.

Yes, in the upcoming session, we can see how to **fade audio with keyframes**, but here let’s look at the other options.

**Step 2**: **Change Soundwaves**

Audio is a mix up of speech, music, etc. Changing the sound waves would bring out a different keyframe. To do so, you can tap on the inverted triangle next to the **Equalizer** option that will offer you various options like **classic, dance, soft, techno**, and a lot more.

**Step 3**: **Remove Background Noise**

To remove unwanted background noise, you can tick the “**Remove Background Noise**” checkbox that will offer you three options: **Weak, Mild,** and **Strong**.

**Step 4**: **Edit the Volume**

If you want to lower the volume of other clips in the video, you can use the “**Lower the volume of other clips**” checkbox next to the ducking option.

It’s not just one, but Filmora offers five attractive choices to modify the created **audio keyframe**.

## Part 3: How to Fade In/Out Audio with Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Now that you are familiar with the method to add **Filmora keyframes** for audio and modifying them, here is a particular part of how you can **fade audio with keyframes**. As it is a special effect with audio keyframe, we have framed a special session with the two methods offered by Wondershare Filmora for Mac.

**Method 1**

**Step 1**: Once you created the **audio keyframe** or double-clicked the video spot where you want to make the keyframe, you will land on the audio panel like the below interface.

**Step 2**: To **fade audio in** keyframe once accessing the audio settings, drag or slide the pointer on the “**Fadein**” option to the right to set the duration.

**Step 3**: To **fade audio out**, you can use the slider next to the “**Fadeout**” option to set the duration.

**Method 2**

* You can directly apply the fade in/out in the **audio keyframe** on the timeline. Once you place the video, the audio track will appear where you can see the icon - the **Fade** option above the audio waveform.
* Dragging the **fade audio in the** handle at the beginning of the clip will impose the effect and set its duration automatically. Pulling the **fade audio out** handle at the end of the clip will impose the fade-out effect.

## Conclusion

No doubt, Wondershare Filmora is the best choice to carry over your **audio keyframing** process. You can customize your creations as per your requirement or need, and Filmora comes in handy as well. Along with practical interpretation on adding an **audio keyframe** and fading audio with keywords, I hope we have resolved the need for an external guide to proceed with the editing process. It’s not just with the process of keyframing, but Wondershare Filmora can do wonders to your design, and so, with no delay, try it out today for free!
