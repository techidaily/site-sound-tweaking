Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.

**Note:** Changing the tempo usually doesn't change the pitch of the audio up to some extent. However, you can expect some variations in the pitch if the new tempo value is too high or too low.

### Conclusion

You may want to **slow down or speed up audio** if the existing one is not up to the mark, and you wish to manage the ambiance with the help of the music track either while playing a video or when merely a soundtrack is to be played during some event. In either case, the best tool for all your needs is Wondershare Filmora, and if you are looking for a program dedicated to audio only, Audacity is something worth trying.

**Note:** Usually, the audio pitch wouldn't change as long as you pick the values anywhere between 0.5x and 5x. However, if you select any option beyond this range, you may experience variations in the pitch according the value you selected.

### Step 3: Set Custom Speed or Reverse the Audio

Click the **Speedometer** icon from above the timeline, and click **Custom Speed** from the menu.
