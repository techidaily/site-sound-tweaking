The music industry is undoubtedly the trendiest platform known for talents, fun, and entertainment. Are you feeling busy or occupied? Hear soft music. Is it your birthday? How about some dashing DJ music? Similarly, there are various situations where music and song play a vital role.

![extract vocal from the song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/extract-vocal-from-the-song.jpg)

However, suppose you want to enjoy your favorite Karaoke-style music beside the vocals or your favorite tune alone on your social media. In that case, you need to extract vocal from the song. While this vocal isolation might seem easy on-screen, it is time-consuming, and more often, the output could be not as expected. You have to strip the song from the primary and backing vocals with **vocal removers** in such circumstances. Thus, we picked up the best reliable online vocal remover apps.

* [Part 1: Top 5 Online Vocal Remover](#part1)
* [Part 2: Best 2 Vocal Remover App](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Extract Vocal from a Song?](#part3)

## Top 5 Online Vocal Remover

First, let’s look at the top 5 online vocal remover tools preferred by many in the market.

#### 1\.  Online UniConverter Vocal Remover

Let’s start with the best online vocal remover for pros and beginners alike - Online UniConverter Vocal Remover. Using this program is dead simple as you only need to add your media file, and the AI system will do the heavy lifting. Unlike most vocal removers on this list, apart from major audio formats, it also supports video formats like MP4, MOV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. In addition to vocals, users can also download the instrumentals and use them in their karaoke sessions. Oh, lest I forget, users can edit the extracted audio by converting, trimming, compressing, and so on.

Below is **how to separate vocals from instrumentals** using Online UniConverter:

**Step 1\. Open the Vocal Remover tool.**

Visit Online UniConverter on your mobile or computer browser and then tap the **Online Tools** tab. From there, click the **Vocal Remover** option to launch the tool.

![Online UniConverter Vocal Remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-vocal-removers-open-online-uniconverter-vocal-remover.jpg)

**Step 2\. Separate vocals from instrumentals.**

![Upload file to vocal remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-file-online-vocal-remover.jpg)

**Step 3\. Download your vocals and enjoy.**

Once your video is uploaded, this vocal remover tool will detect and separate the instrumental and vocals automatically. After extracting vocals successfully, click the **Play** icon beside the extracted file to preview it. Then, if satisfied, simply click the **Download** button to save the file in your local storage. Or, you can cut the audio or join the audio accordingly with other tools.

![download separated vocal file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-separately-vocal-file.jpg)
