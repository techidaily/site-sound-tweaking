Why would we want to remove audio from video?

There are many reasons why someone would prefer to remove the audio from a video file. Some of the videos captured will have a lot of noise in the background and that can be an annoying experience while watching the video. Some prefer to add different audio or a music file to their videos to make it more appealing and attractive to people. So whether it is to watch a silent video or a video with a different audio file, the original audio will have to be removed.

In no particular order, here we are going to discuss 4 different applications that can be used to remove audio from video without compromising the quality of your video.

_(All features of the samples are subjected to the time.)_

## Best Video Editing Software to Remove Audio from Video

Apart from removing sound from video, the applications below also offer features that can be used to further edit the audio file. Here are some of the best and preferred applications for audio removal and replacement.

* Open Filmora, then go to **File**\-**Import Media** and import the video clip from which audio needs to be removed to the Media Library

![import-media8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-media8.jpg)

* After importing drag the clip from the Media Library and drop it to the Timeline
* Right-click on the video file on the timeline and select the **Detach Audio** option

![detach-audio-filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora.jpg)

* Now the audio will be displayed as a separate file on the audio track below

![detach-out-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-out-audio.jpg)

* Now tap on the audio file and select the **Delete** icon to totally remove the audio.

![no-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-audio.jpg)

Tips:

You can add fresh audio to your video clip the same way how added the video to the timeline (import, drag, and drop). Filmora also has features that allow further editing of an audio clip and adding effects.

## [Part 2: VSDC Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/)

VSDC is a widely used video editing application that can process videos of high resolution like VR 360-degree, 4K UHD, 3D videos. It also has features to record voice, video from the screen and save the file in any format of our choice. Let us see how audio can be removed from video by using VSDC:

* Open VSDC and import the file you wish to edit
* Right-click on the file using the mouse and select the **Properties** option from the menu. A small window will slide from the right side of the screen

![vsdc-properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-properties.jpg)

![vsdc-split-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-split-audio.jpg)

* Now the audio file will be separated from the video file on the timeline

![vsdc-audio-out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-audio-out.jpg)

* Click on the audio file and hit **Delete**. The video can now be played without any sound

Tips:

VSDC also offers an option to mute the audio instead of deleting it, but the deletion of audio is the recommended process to get rid of audio.
