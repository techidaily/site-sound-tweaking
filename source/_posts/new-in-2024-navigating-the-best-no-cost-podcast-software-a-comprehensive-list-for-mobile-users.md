The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.

Compared to Audacity, Filmora’s AI Vocal Remover tool is quick and easy to use. It will facilitate your video editing process by allowing you to remove vocals and use instrumentals on the go. For instance, this feature allows you to easily dub any video without having to cover up the current vocals. This means that your videos will be more entertaining and engaging while keeping great soundtracks. Match the energy in your videos with the quality of the instrumentals with just a few clicks.

## **Conclusion**

Removing vocals from a video song or audio file gives you more freedom in your projects. You can use the audio as an instrumental or in other creative ways. Audacity is among the most popular vocal removers on the internet. It offers several ways to remove vocals clearly from your audio tracks or music files. Vocal isolation audacity is easy and takes only a few steps. However, we recommend the AI vocal remover feature by Filmora because it is more versatile and accurate. The automated feature takes care of everything for you when removing the vocals from your audio files. You also get to utilize other useful video editing features that automate mundane tasks.

### 3\. [MP3TrueEdit for Mac](http://www.macsome.com/audio-splitter-mac/)

MP3TrueEdit is a simple audio splitter Mac tool that has been designed to edit MP3 audio files. While it costs $11.99 on the Mac App Store, you can download and try it for free. The developers have made the app to split or edit files without the need to decompress and recompress the audio. It guarantees that there is no loss in the quality. It is also designed to protect the audio file from becoming corrupt or invalid during the splitting process.

MP3TrueEdit is more than just an audio splitter Mac software. It is an audio editing tool that allows you to edit audio files.

### 4\. [MP3 Trimmer (Mac)](http://www.deepniner.net/mp3trimmer/)

MP3 Trimmer (Mac) is a quite easy to use audio splitter Mac tool. Not only does it allow you to split MP3 files, it can also be used to edit, join, repair, analyze audio files, and a lot more. There’s no need to re-encode and convert file formats with the use of various applications. All you need is the MP3 Trimmer if you want to remove portions of your MP3 files without losing the quality.

With the MP3 Trimmer, you will be able to remove the undesired portion of the audio file, add some fade-in/fade-out effects, change gain and add silence. If you have a couple of large audio files that needs to be split, then you can benefit from the batch-edit feature of the MP3 Trimmer. It also has built-in tools that will help you analyze and repair broken audio files. It is free to use as long as you want.

### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
