Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**
