**Cons of using the usual professional software:**

However, this professional editing software might not be the most suitable tool for you. There are a number of disadvantages of using them.

* Firstly, if you are a computer novice, these tools are never meant for you. Only if you have substantial experience working with computers will you be able to manage and manipulate the tools and achieve intended results. The functions of different built-in instruments and features can appear to be complicated sometimes.
* While working with videos, the usual method is somewhat complex. You’d have to extract the audio from the video file first and then apply that to the editing tools.
* While the work is in progress, checking whether the audio track matches the video is very difficult. To do that, you’d have to wait until the job is done.
