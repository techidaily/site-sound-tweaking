There are times when you need to split audio files with the use of your Mac. The fastest and best way to do the task is with the use of an audio splitter for Mac. There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.

## Part 1\. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Although widely known as the best video editing software for beginners, Wondershare Filmora [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) also serves as a great audio editing tool. It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.

One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button. Download a free trial version to try it right now:

## Part 2\. Five Best Audio Trimming Tools You Can Choose

Below are the top 5 audio splitters for Mac devices you can choose to use. Read on to take a close look at them.

### 1\. [Mp3splt (Mac)](http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/mp3splt%5Fpage/home.php)

Mp3splt(Mac) is one of the best audio splitter software available. It is open-source software that has the ability to split MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio files. It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.

The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.

![mp3splt ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3splt.jpg)

### 2\. [Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware](http://www.macsome.com/audio-splitter-mac/)

Another free audio splitting software running on Mac computer that you can use is Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware. It can be used to split MP3 files into smaller files in just a couple of seconds. It preserves the tags and the sound quality of the files while splitting them. It also allows batch splitting, which is good if you have several audio files that you need to split. To split audio files, you can select by time or number of pieces. You can also choose the start and end time to split.

## Essential 2023 Playlist: The Most Influential Rock Hits So Far

It wasn't easy getting through 2021\. But the world of rock background music made it a bit easier. This is how 2021 killed the myth that rock ever vanished. Let's check out some of these gems that can create a rock vibe for you to enjoy.

## Top 15 Rock Songs

We have come up with varied songs by singers all around the globe who create a classic rock vibe for listeners with hip hop background music.

### 1\. Ann Wilson, "Black Wing"

Wilson was inspired to write "Black Wing" on birds that are pure flying spirits that connect the threads of nature. You'll experience monstrous drums and power chords. This song uses delicate acoustic strums and a repeating keyboard riff to show contrasts in the world.

### 2\. Tears for Fears, "No Small Thing"

The legends, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith are best known for the pop hits like "Shout" and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."

For once in nearly 18 years, the duo taps into a folk-rock sound. It's something new and darker for the band, but it doesn't feel forced. They still represent the previous work that made them what they are today. "No Small Things" proves that even after 40 years of their coming, they still have so much to offer to the world.

### 3\. Rise Against, "Nowhere Generation"

Rise Against speaks for the marginalized people out there through his songs. This title track of their latest album is one of the most poignant songs in their entire catalogue. The lyrics hone in on the idealism of the "American dream" related to a current generation of youths growing up in a world of social, economic and political instability.

### 4\. [As Everything Unfolds - On The Inside (Official Video)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIR9QXRmzAY)

As Everything Unfolds made a sweet blend of mid-2000s emo and modern metal in 2021\. "On the Inside" is a song you get hooked to in all the ways. This anthem gave us all the energy and made the year a little more joyful. Check it out now!

### 5\. [Mastodon - Pain With An Anchor \[Official Audio\]](https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8GeSCV2bZI)
