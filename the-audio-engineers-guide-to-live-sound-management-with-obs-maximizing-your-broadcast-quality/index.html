<p>Video making or filmmaking has now come to the level where the history of imperfections faded away a long time ago. Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is <strong>ducking sound</strong> that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren’t a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn’t needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this <strong>ducking music</strong> process, we have this post.</p>
<p>If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn’t a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing <strong>audio ducking</strong> in a step-wise way. With primary importance to the popular software <strong>OBS</strong> followed by a suitable alternative, let’s begin our article!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?"></a>Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?</h2><p><strong>OBS</strong> (Open Broadcaster Software) is free and open-source software reliable for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.13+. With countless features like real video&#x2F;audio capture, mixer, custom transitions, easy-to-use configurations, pre-source filters, VST plug-in support, noise suppression, and a lot more, you can accomplish audio ducking in OBS by adding a sidechain&#x2F;ducking compression filter. Thus, perform OBS audio ducking in a clean manner by lowering the audio automatically once OBS detects audio on the other audio source.</p>
<p>Does this magic of OBS audio ducking seem new to you? It will not be anymore as the below step-by-step manual will guide you through the process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add video files</strong></p>
<p>Launch the OBS software on your system, and import the files into the workspace with the “File” menu. If you need to add voiceover from your microphone, you can click the “Start Recording” option under the main interface’s control section.</p>
<p>If the video plays on VLC in the background, it will appear on the mixer column.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose filter and compressor</strong></p>
<p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> icon next to the streaming video, click on it, and choose the “Filters” option from the drop-down.</p>
<p>You will reach the pop-up of the “Filters for Desktop Audio” whereby clicking on the “+” icon, choose the compressor option.</p>
<p>On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for <strong>ducking music</strong>, specify as “ducking,” and press “OK.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Change the parameters</strong></p>
<p>You can now specify the values of the ratio, threshold, attack, release, output gain, and the ducking source, for example, “Mic” for microphone voiceover addition.</p>
<p>It’s complete. Yes, OBS audio ducking is over. Now you can check the video and alter the parameters if required after a preview.</p>

<p>Video making or filmmaking has now come to the level where the history of imperfections faded away a long time ago. Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is <strong>ducking sound</strong> that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren’t a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn’t needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this <strong>ducking music</strong> process, we have this post.</p>
<p>If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn’t a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing <strong>audio ducking</strong> in a step-wise way.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose filter and compressor</strong></p>

<p>You will reach the pop-up of the “Filters for Desktop Audio” whereby clicking on the “+” icon, choose the compressor option.</p>
<p>On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for <strong>ducking music</strong>, specify as “ducking,” and press “OK.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Change the parameters</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, you need to access Voicemod PRO and tap onto the “Voice Maker” option from the list.</p>
<p>We will choose accordingly from the various options Voicemod PRO provides, such as robotic voice or any other fictional character. You will tap on the “Double Pitch” generator button for the users looking for an anime voice changer.</p>
<p>To configure the Anime voice, you will have to adjust Pitch: Mix I 100%, Pitch I 80%, and Humanizer I OFF. On the other hand, Mix II 100%, Pitch II 70%, and Humanizer II ON.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Make-an-Anime-Voice-in-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#Part-2-Make-an-Anime-Voice-in-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make an Anime Voice in Adobe Premiere"></a>Part 2: Make an Anime Voice in Adobe Premiere</h2><p>Adobe Premiere is a software application for video content creators and editors. In the case of TV series or dramas, even professional actors often need a bit of pitch adjustment to voices. Pitch shifting is not only made easy but accessible to all as well in Premiere Pro. Below all the key steps are highlighted, which provide you with the precise process of making anime voice in PR.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" Anime voice changer  premiere  "
                ></p>
<p>Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the “Pitch Shifter” effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose “pitch shifter,” and then drag down to the audio file.</p>
<p>Next, it’s time to adjust the pitch as per the need. We can shift the pitch higher for a sharp female voice or down for heavier vocals. If you now have achieved the desired results, you know how to use this anime girl voice changer.</p>
<p>Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio. This effect is usually a popular trend with anime voice changers. To give nasal effects, you have to load the EQ first. Next, you need to cut or boost the frequencies as per your need. The limit provided is usually 1k to 1.2k Hz.</p>
<p>These are the main effects one gets to choose from when using Adobe Premiere.</p>

<p>Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the “Pitch Shifter” effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose “pitch shifter,” and then drag down to the audio file.</p>
<p>Next, it’s time to adjust the pitch as per the need. We can shift the pitch higher for a sharp female voice or down for heavier vocals. If you now have achieved the desired results, you know how to use this anime girl voice changer.</p>
<p>Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio. This effect is usually a popular trend with anime voice changers. To give nasal effects, you have to load the EQ first. Next, you need to cut or boost the frequencies as per your need. The limit provided is usually 1k to 1.2k Hz.</p>
<p>These are the main effects one gets to choose from when using Adobe Premiere.</p>

Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>
