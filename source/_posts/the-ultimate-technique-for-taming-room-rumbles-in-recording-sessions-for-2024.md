### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
