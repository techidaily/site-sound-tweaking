## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.

* [**Part 1: Best iOS DAW for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best iOS DAW for iPhone**](#part2)

## Part 1ï¼šBest iOS DAW for iPad

**Price:** Free with optional pay-to-add features

[GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad) is a high-quality DAW that allows you to use the Audio Unit (AU) standard. You can edit, enhance, distort, add an echo, and even a reverb, all through this one platform. GarageBand is the best iOS DAW for iPad if you happen to be a beginner. It does lack some of the finesse of the more significant, more professional systems.

**Features:**

* Apple sound and loop library is packed with choice and easily accessible.

![GarageBand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/garageband-phone.JPG)

### 2\. [Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519)

**Price**: $23.99

[Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519) is an app by Stienberg which features multiple sound sequencing and some other cool features. It comes in Cubasis, Cubasis Le (the compact version), and the updated Cubasis 2 and 3\. This is considered the best iOS DAW for iPad because it is designed to be quick and easy to use.

**Features:**

* Newest version works with both iPad and iPhone.
* Full mixer with level meters, zooms, multi-layer audio, and rearrangeable inserts.

![Cubasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/cubasis-phone.JPG)

### 3\. [FL Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619)

**Price:** $13.99

[FL Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619) is filled with heavy synths like Sakura and Harmless. Itâ€™s also able to compress, features a ton of presets, and comes with a step sequencer that can allow any sound samples to be added to, or kick-started by, the sequencer. It applies numerous optional plugins and VSTs, which make it ideal for beginners. They specialize in making it all fairly easy to understand, even for new users.

**Features:**

[Auxy Pro â€“ Music & Beat Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-pro-music-beat-maker/id1034348186#?platform=ipad) is one of the best DAWs for iPad because it is similar to a musical sketchbook, if you like.

Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.
