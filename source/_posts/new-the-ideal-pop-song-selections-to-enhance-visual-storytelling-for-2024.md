## Essential Techniques for Striking Podcast Cover Designs: Your Step-by-Step Guide (2023 Edition)

# How to Design an Awesome Podcast Cover Art: an Ultimate Guide

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you have ever considered the importance of visual marketing, it is where the Podcast cover art comes in. Before anyone hits your Podcast and listens to it, they will usually be attracted to the first impressions of cover design. Either you can create a simple podcast cover design or go for a strategic Podcast cover art that beautifully resembles what you are going to offer in the Podcast.

![Podcast Cover Art](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/podcast-cover-art.jpg)

So, don't think that only the Podcast's content is crucial; instead, every element related to your Podcast is essential. It is like considering A-Z of your Podcast routine to stand out better among others. No matter how useful the Podcast's content is, its cover design's unprofessional look says a lot more about the host. Thus, it would help if you tried to teach professionalism in every aspect of Podcast creation.

We are going to specifically look at Podcast cover art in the following guide section. It will discuss the meaning, importance, and process of creating a stunning Podcast cover design.

* [Part1: What is Podcast Cover Art?](#part1)
* [Part2: Why does the Podcast Cover Art Matter?](#part2)
* [Part3: How to design a stunning Podcast Cover Art?](#part3)

## What is Podcast Cover Art?

In simple terms, Podcast cover art makes a cover design that usually represents the Podcast's host and content. It also includes the brand name and logo. A Podcast cover design must be simple yet appealing to the eyes of listeners. You must always do less and avoid being too overwhelming with the images. Simultaneously, the Podcast cover art must successfully resonate with the ultimate message of the Podcast. It should not be like an alien to your Podcast's content.

![What Is Podcast Cover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-podcast-cover.jpg)

Given below are certain elements your Podcast cover design must incorporate.

* You must check for the size of the Podcast cover beforehand. Your Podcast will host on different platforms, which require the cover arts of various sizes. So, what you need to check is the preview of your Podcast cover art on such different scenarios, not to look odd.
* Limit the use of words on Podcast cover design to avoid any confusion in the mind of listeners.
* Avoid using the images that have been in use on other Podcasts or social platforms. You must consider designing a unique artwork to create a brand identity.
* Please avoid using the artwork elements at the bottom, as they are not highly noticeable due to play indicators.
