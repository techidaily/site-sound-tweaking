An **audio-to-text converter** is a tool that can convert audio files to texts or even record any audio and produce the text of it simultaneously. Audio files are one of the most used methods of storing information. From online classes and long lectures to big business meetings and product information, audio is being shared a lot across the world.

But accessing information from a long audio file can be difficult and time-consuming, which is why there is a need to convert audio to text. Information in the form of text can easily be fully or partly accessed and edited whenever needed. And texts can also easily be shared with whomever you want.
