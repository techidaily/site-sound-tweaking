You can download the Wondershare Filmora video editor software from the official website. It offers a free version of the software for you to download. You can also buy the software for premium features.

##### Step 2 Import Media

You can import media by clicking on the 'File' menu and tapping on the 'Import Media' subheading. It will open a dialog box prompting you to choose 'Import Media Files.' You can then browse your pc to import the gif.

##### Step 3 Edit Image

You can choose to edit the image by changing the placement. You can also use options like pan, zoom in, or out. Another thing you can do with the image is color-match the entire gif. You can breathe new life into your gif by adjusting the image's transparency.

You can change the duration of the image in a gif using the 'Duration' setting. You can also rotate the image under the transform panel. You can also flip the image horizontally or vertically. Explore the transition effects available on the platform.

##### Step 4 Add Audio

You can import an audio file from your device the same way you imported the image. Another option is to choose a soundtrack from one of the royalty-free sounds available in the Filmora library. It has a wide selection of audio available for use.

##### Step 5 Add Effects To Audio

There are many cool effects that you can use when inserting audio into your image. You can trim the audio to fit the gif. You can customize the point at which the audio begins. You can add voiceovers.

This video editor allows you to adjust the audio speed. It can't just increase or decrease the speed of the audio. You can also decide if the music should 'fade in' or 'fade out.' You can also adjust the volume of the audio you're playing.

##### Step 6 Export File

You can now export the file as an mp4\. If you choose to export the file as a gif, you will lose the audio, so please be careful when exporting the file. Also, a gif cannot be longer than 30 seconds, or it becomes a video.

Finding a gif with sound can be easy if you know where to look. What's even easier than finding a gif with sound is to add music to gif. We've covered the gamut from online websites you can create gif with sounds to powerful video editors.

You can use the website for casual use. It doesn't offer a lot of set-up time, but it doesn't give you much control over the gif either. A reliable and user-friendly video editor can help provide you with creative control and creative direction.

Using Wondershare Filmora can help you create better quality gifs with sound. The control is far superior, and it suits amateurs and experts alike. So go forth and unleash your best creative self today with Wondershare Filmora
