The Beatfind app is just like [Shazam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8) music recognition app, but with audio visualization options, as it enables you to discover new music just moments after you hear it for the first time. The music recognition mode that uses the ACR Cloud technology identifies the song if the app is active and near a speaker. The app’s music visualizer relies on your phone’s microphone to gather sound data and synchronize the visuals with the audio input. However, Beatfind doesn’t provide the tools that allow you to customize or record your music visualizations.

This is a perfect option for all iPhone users who want to have almost total control over the process of visualizing their music.

ProjectM is probably one of the best music visualization apps for Android and iOS oprating systems as it contains hundreds of visual effects, multi-touch interactive visuals, and it provides Chromecast support. There are also several different modes available such as the Immersive Mode for KitKat devices or Live Wallpaper mode that creates animated wallpapers for your Smartphone.
