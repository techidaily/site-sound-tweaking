## How to Choose a Music Recognition App?

Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices. But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.

There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:

* **Speed**

Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.

Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.

* **Tenacity**

As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.

The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.

* **Accuracy**

Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.

Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.
