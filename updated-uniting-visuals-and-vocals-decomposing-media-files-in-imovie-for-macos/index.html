How to Separate&#x2F;Detach&#x2F;Split Audio from Video in iMovie on Mac"></a>Part 1. How to Separate&#x2F;Detach&#x2F;Split Audio from Video in iMovie on Mac</h2><p>The iMovie program is capable of producing high-quality movies and videos. If you’re dealing with a video that includes both sound and pictures, you may want to split the two at some point.</p>
<p>To separate audio from video in iMovie on Mac, just open the video and follow the steps below.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Remove-the-audio-clip-from-the-video"><a href="#Step-1-Remove-the-audio-clip-from-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Remove the audio clip from the video"></a>Step 1. Remove the audio clip from the video</h4><p>In your iMovie timeline, find the clip that contains both video and audio.</p>
<p>Right-click the clip or hold <strong>Control</strong> and click it. You can also go to the menu bar and choose <strong>Detach Audio</strong>.</p>
<p>The audio from that clip will then show as its own “clip” in green below the video. The little line on the left, however, confirms that the video and audio are still connected. This implies that if you delete the video, you’ll lose the audio as well. As a result, you’ll either need to move the audio clip somewhere else in your video or place it in the Background Music Well at the bottom of the timeline.</p>
<p>Simply select, drag, and drop the green audio clip where you want it. It will be in the background of all other noises in your movie if you set it in the Background Music Well.</p>
