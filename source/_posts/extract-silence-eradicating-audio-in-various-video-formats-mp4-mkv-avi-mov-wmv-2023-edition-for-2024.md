### Step 2: Separating Audio from Video

Separate the audio track from the video to work on it specifically. Right-click the video file within the timeline and select "Audio Detach." This action creates a separate audio file that can be edited separately.

![separate audio from video with detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-background-noise-in-audio-wondershare-filmora-tutorial-4.jpg)

### Step 3: Selecting the background noise option

Right-click on the audio track within the timeline and select "Edit." This will open the background noise menu, where you can adjust the audio quality.

First, use the "Denoise" function to reduce background noise. Don't worry if the initial denoising doesn't meet your expectations; there are other options. If you want a strong denoising effect, move the slider to "Strong" or "Mid."

![select audio denoise in the tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-background-noise-in-audio-wondershare-filmora-tutorial-5.jpg)

### Step 4: Adjusting your audio

Using the denoise function may result in a little distortion of the voice or other audio elements. To enhance your audio quality, you can also use the "Equalizer" tool above the Denoise function. Enhance sound quality with the Equalizer tool by customizing the audio settings.

![adjust the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-background-noise-in-audio-wondershare-filmora-tutorial-6.jpg)

Default settings are zero for the equalizer. You should focus on the first four settings on the left side, which control the bass frequencies. Reduce the leftmost setting and adjust the mid-tones to avoid that robotic sound. Right-sidе еqualizеr sеttings, which dеal with high-pitchеd trеblе noisе, don't nееd to bе adjustеd.

## Part 3\. Significance Of Background Noise Removal In Audio Production

High-quality audio requires removing background noise. Listeners may find it difficult to understand and follow an audio recording when background noise is present.

![significance of background noise removal in audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-background-noise-in-audio-wondershare-filmora-tutorial-9.jpg)

### An adverse effect of background noise on audio quality

Background noise distracts and obscures the intended message. The line between important and irrelevant is blurred. The content can be difficult to focus on, understand, and connect with. Sound effects, music, and voices become unclear, causing frustration.

Background noise can undermine content creators' credibility and professional image. Excessive noise signals a need for attention to detail and quality, whether you are an educator, a storyteller, or a business professional. Background noise isn't simply a nuisance, it's a communication barrier.

### The benefits of removing background noise from videos

Your audience can be engaged and interested in your message if background noise is removed. Background sound removers have several benefits, including

#### ● Content with crystal-clear audio

It is easier to understand and follow information when background noise is removed. Listeners will find the audio more engaging and enjoyable.

#### ● Engagement of listeners

It is more likely that listeners will stay engaged with the content when background noise is removed, as they won't have to strain to hear the content. Engagement and retention are crucial for keeping audiences interested.

#### ● Engages listeners and builds trust

Audio content that is clear and free of background noise helps build trust. It is easier for listeners to feel confident about your brand when they can hear your message clearly. Your content is more likely to gain loyalty and advocacy when listeners trust you.

#### ● Makes it easier for people to share

Listeners are more likely to share audio content that is crisp, engaging, and professional. Removing background noise increases the likelihood of your content being shared and recommended, resulting in new listeners and opportunities.
