**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you donâ€™t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesnâ€™t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools.

After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesnâ€™t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, letâ€™s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after theyâ€™ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesnâ€™t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTubeâ€™s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.
