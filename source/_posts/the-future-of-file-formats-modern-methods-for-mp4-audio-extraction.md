## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.

The app’s functional design makes it easy to find and manage podcasts by enabling you to create playback queues effortlessly. **Trimming silence, skipping intros or streaming episodes** without downloading them are just a few among countless options the Pocket Casts app offers.

Moreover, the **Car Play feature** enables you to play audio and video podcasts wherever you go. You can also download podcasts if you want to listen to them while you are offline.

Besides, you can play all episodes on your TV or your sound system using the **Airplay and Chromecast integrations**. The only downside is that you have to **purchase the annual or monthly plan** if you want to use all of the Pocket Casts’ podcasting options.

### 7\. Apple Podcasts

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029)

This is one of the most popular destinations for all iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch owners who listen to podcasts frequently. Apple Podcasts lets you browse through more than 750.000 shows and 20 million episodes that are organized into categories. You can subscribe to any show you find on Apple Podcasts for free, download episodes you like to your Apple devices and listen to them wherever you go.

The platform’s editor recommends the shows based on your browsing history and helps you discover content that you are going to enjoy watching and listening to. Even so, Apple Podcasts lack the tools that enable its users to control the playback speed, skip intros or set timers before they go to sleep.

### 8\. Spotify

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [web-based](https://www.spotify.com/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en)

People from all over the world have been using Spotify to enjoy music from virtually any genre ever created. This Swedish-American company has been investing a lot into its podcasting services in the last couple of years.

Today Spotify offers access to podcasters to one of the most massive online audiences.

There are thousands of podcasts to browse through on Spotify, and some of them can only be played through this podcast player, either online or on iPhone or Android devices.

![Best Podcast Player App - Overcast ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overcast-podcast-player.jpg)

Overcast was launched just five years ago, but today it is **recognized as one of the best podcast player apps for iPhones, iWatches, and iPads.** If you are looking for an app that will shorten the silences in podcasts, normalize the volume of the voices or enable you to adjust the playback speed of the audio files, then Overcast is probably one of your best options.

The app also provides **CarPlay support** and allows you to listen to your favorite podcasts even while you are on the road. However, Overcast contains ads, and you must purchase the Premium version of the app if you want to remove them.

### 10\. Castro

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241)

![Best Podcast Player App - Castro Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/castro-podcast-player.jpg)

Managing large numbers of episodes with Castro won’t take much more than a few moments of your time. Subscribe to a podcast you like, and all of the latest episodes will land in the New tab. You can then decide if you want to add them to the queue and listen to them while you are driving or on your iPhone.

The free version of the app doesn’t allow you to skip intros, enhance voices or reduce silence, and you must purchase Castro Plus to access these options. Before you decide to install Castro or Castro Plus on your device, you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of iOS you have.

### 11\. Podbean

**Price:** Free but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id973361050), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podbean.app.podcast&referrer=utm%5Fsource%3Dpodbean%5Fweb%26utm%5Fcampaign%3Dpb%5Flanding%5Fapp)

![Best Podcast Player App - Podbean Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/podbean-podcast-app-player.jpg)

With the selection of over 50 million episodes, Podbean is easily one of the most versatile podcast player apps on this list.

Podbean is equipped with an **audio recorder** that features a rich selection of audio effects and a versatile set of audio editing tools. Moreover, the app provides support for live audio streaming so you can create or listen to live broadcast directly from your Smartphone.

### 12\. Laughable

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:**[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/laughable/id1078473343), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laughable&hl=en%5FUS)

![Best Podcast Player App - Laughable Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/laughable-podcast-player-app.jpg)

Keeping in touch with the latest trends in the comedy world is going to become easy if you install Laughable on your device.

Each time they release a new episode of their podcast or make a guest appearance, you’ll receive a notification, which enables you to follow their latest work.

Besides an impressive collection of comedy podcasts, Laughable also lets you browse through podcasts featuring celebrities like Jordan Peterson, Barak Obama or Oprah. The app is free for just ten days, afterward, you must upgrade to Laughable Insider if you want to have access to all the shows and episodes this podcast player has to offer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
