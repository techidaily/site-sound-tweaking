## "Windows Audio Enhancement: Top Ten Applications to Transform Your Music Experience"

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Mostly audio ducking is processed for movies or any live sessions that reduce the background music when the characters or person speaks on the screen and increases the speaker's volume. The scenario happens vice versa when the speaker completes its conversation. Here, the background music increases, and the speaker's audio is reduced drastically. This type of audio ducking occurs to enhance the audio quality and reach the target audience without any issues.
