## "Experience Unparalleled Audio Quality on Windows with These 10 Tools (2022 Update)"

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

All video files that are captured with GoPro and other types of digital cameras contain sound, but in certain situations, you may get the â€˜The file has no audio or video streamsâ€™ after you try to [import mp4, mov and MTS files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) into Adobe Premiere Pro.

This can be quite frustrating, even though, in most cases, you wonâ€™t use the sound that was recorded by the camera in the final cut of your video. This problem can be solved quickly, so in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods of fixing audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro.

 **Read More to Get :** [Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Four Ways to Solve Audio Importing Issues in Adobe Premiere Pro

There are numerous factors that can cause Adobe Premiere Pro to [stop functioning properly](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2356540), and if the app wonâ€™t let you import video files into a project because it has no audio or video streams, there are few things you can do to fix this without having to reinstall the operating system on your computer or the version of Adobe Premiere Pro youâ€™re currently using.

### [![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. Clearing the Media File Cache

If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the **Edit menu** and select the **Preferences Tab.** Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the **Media tab** and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the **Media Cache Database** and **Media Cache Files** folders. Restart the application after youâ€™ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.

![clear Media File Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg)

### 2\. Renaming the Media Cache Folder

The default location of Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files folders is **/Users/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common** on Mac computers and **\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common** on PC computers. So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to **Media Cache Files\_OLD** and **Media Cache\_OLD**. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.

### 3\. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder

If renaming the folders didnâ€™t do the trick you can try moving them from their default location. You can move them wherever you want on your computer, but it is best if you pick a location that is easy to remember, just so you can access them quickly in case you need to delete files that are stored in them.

### 4\. Installing the QuickTime Player

Sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective one. Check if QuickTime is installed on your computer because installing this player can solve the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro. Furthermore, if you just reinstalled the OS on your computer, you should [download and install QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime), before launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you create a new project go to the **Edit menu**, find the **Preferences submenu and select the Media option**. Clean both the **Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files** folders, restart Adobe Premiere Pro and then import the video files into your project.

![install QuickTime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/QuickTime-Player-no-sound-premiere.jpg)

## An Alternative Way to Import Video Without This Issue

If you fail to import your video across Adobe Premiere Pro and want to get some work done across the file, you can look for [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora provides a pervasive set of tools to work with. With multiple editing tools to work with, you can easily manage your audio across the platform.

## Four Ways to Solve Audio Importing Issues in Adobe Premiere Pro

There are numerous factors that can cause Adobe Premiere Pro to [stop functioning properly](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2356540), and if the app wonâ€™t let you import video files into a project because it has no audio or video streams, there are few things you can do to fix this without having to reinstall the operating system on your computer or the version of Adobe Premiere Pro youâ€™re currently using.

### [![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. Clearing the Media File Cache

If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the **Edit menu** and select the **Preferences Tab.** Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the **Media tab** and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the **Media Cache Database** and **Media Cache Files** folders. Restart the application after youâ€™ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.

![clear Media File Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg)

### 2\. Renaming the Media Cache Folder

The default location of Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files folders is **/Users/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common** on Mac computers and **\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common** on PC computers. So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to **Media Cache Files\_OLD** and **Media Cache\_OLD**. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.

### 3\. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder

If renaming the folders didnâ€™t do the trick you can try moving them from their default location. You can move them wherever you want on your computer, but it is best if you pick a location that is easy to remember, just so you can access them quickly in case you need to delete files that are stored in them.

### 4\. Installing the QuickTime Player

Sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective one. Check if QuickTime is installed on your computer because installing this player can solve the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro. Furthermore, if you just reinstalled the OS on your computer, you should [download and install QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime), before launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you create a new project go to the **Edit menu**, find the **Preferences submenu and select the Media option**. Clean both the **Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files** folders, restart Adobe Premiere Pro and then import the video files into your project.
