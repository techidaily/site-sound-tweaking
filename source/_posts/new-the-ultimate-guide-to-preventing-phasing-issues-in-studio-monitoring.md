Step 1: For creating an extraordinary robotic voice, start by launching Audacity on your device. After it opens, it's time to record your voice to create a robot voice. Or else, head to the 'File' tab and import your audio file from your device to Audacity from the 'Open' option.

Step 2: After this, to start the editing, you need a stereo track on the timeline. For doing this, navigate ‘Tracks’ from the top menu and click on it. Next, hover on the 'Add New' option to open its sub-menu. You will see the 'Stereo Track' option, select it, and copy-paste the audio file in the new section.

Step 3: Let's start with the fun part, the editing and adjusting different features. Start by opening the 'Effects' tab, and from the long list of options, select 'Echo.' There, you can enter the 'Delay Time' and change other fields as well.

Step 4: Preview the audio and move on to the next setting. Open the 'Effects' section and look for the 'Change Pitch' option. You can change and adjust the pitch according to your desire and preview the file again.

Step 5: For creating a robot voice, you can also set the tempo. For that, head to the 'Change Tempo' option under the ‘Effects’ section and set the value to minus. Keep adjusting the different effects until you get your perfect robot voice.
