The sound effects are organized by categories so you can browse through Explosion, Industrial or Nature categories while searching for effects you want to use in your video. The Glitches category contains a huge selection of different glitch sound effects that can be downloaded in either mp3 or wav formats.

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

However, each effect that is available in the Glitches subcategory of the Sound Design category must be purchased and their prices vary from $1,5 to $6,5\.

Even though you can use this platform for free, there are a few subscription plans you can choose from in case you want to download premium media assets or gain access to the platform’s standard library. Furthermore, the free version of Filmstock doesn’t offer any glitch sound effects, so if you want to download audio effects like Lazer Blast, Static Disturbance or Sci-Fi Glitches you will have to opt for a subscription plan that enables you to gain access to these effects.
