            <h2 id="“Discovering-the-Best-Five-No-Fee-Auditory-Standardizers”"><a href="#“Discovering-the-Best-Five-No-Fee-Auditory-Standardizers”" class="headerlink" title="“Discovering the Best Five No-Fee Auditory Standardizers”"></a>“Discovering the Best Five No-Fee Auditory Standardizers”</h2><p>When you are listening to music, or to podcast, or some other type of audio files, would it make it enjoyable if the volume was so low at some point that you couldn’t understand anything? Now add another possibility to this very unpleasant imagination – what if the volume was so high at another point that your ears can’t handle it? – Of course, you would stop listening, and you would also not think high of the creator of this content. In other words, this will become the reason why this creator might lose their audiences. Well, sad story for the creator, isn’t it? And, what if YOU were the creator? A little laziness or a failure in paying attention to detail and your content goes to waste!</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? Of course, a little editing! Even if your voice doesn’t sound like it’s worth listening, you can make it happen by normalizing the volume. This actually is the process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. When this tool is applied to the volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece is affected the same way, and the relative dynamics are not changed.</p>
<p>With this tool, you have an extra guarantor that people will want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners, because simply, their user experience is now favored, they enjoy a good, edited content.</p>
<p>Actually, we might use audio normalizing when we need to get the maximum volume, but another reason is is when we need to match different volumes.</p>
<p>As in most cases, there is not only one type of audio normalization, so let’s explain what each of them represents: one is a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p>
<p>With this knowledge in mind, let’s now move to the topic we are going to cover in this article: let’s discuss 5 best free MP3 volume normalizers. Knowing about them will save you time and equip you with the right ways so that when you are going to need audio normalization, you will choose one of them, bypass exhausting process of the research, and find the free, easy-to-use programs that will help you master your sounds!</p>
<p>So, we chose the following programs as 5 best free MP3 normalizers: Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi.</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora-X"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-X" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora X"></a>Wondershare Filmora X</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs. Something worth discussing is a software called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which carries out the same task wonderfully. Although, unlike VLC Media Player, it is a real video editor, but don’t panic if you have never laid your hand on editing – it is one of the easiest to use ini the word, operating also both on Mac and Windows, and its interface is utterly understandable for beginners right away. And, actually, it is a qhile that Wondershare Filmora X introduced the feature to normalize the audio for the first time. What to say more - you might want to stop now and download the latest version of Filmora X because now we are about to learn how to normalize audio from the video there – so, tune in!</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

<p>When it is done installing, open the software. Now, click and drag the video of which the audio you want to normalize. Now you can select the clip you have chosen – if there are multiple, select all of them, then right-click and choose Detach Audio.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora x"
                ></p>
<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-02.jpg"
                      alt="noises are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-03.jpg"
                      alt="select files"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-04.jpg"
                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-05.jpg"
                      alt="complete normalization"
                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>
<h2 id="Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>Adobe Premiere Pro</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is the industry-leading video editing software, and it is a timeline-based. Premiere Pro always tries to make its use easier and easier, as new features are rolling out regularly to simplify steps and save time. The very same can be said about normalizing audio files, which is actually pretty easy once mastered in a very short time. That is actually why it used by beginners and professionals alike.</p>
<p>To normalize audio Adobe Premiere Pro, first, import your MP3 there. In the timeline, you will see your files in the sequence, in the sound section. Now, the best way to work on them is increase the track height – for that, you need to double-click on the empty space there, next to the little microphone icon.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="increase track height"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the track is high, and you can see more of your track. So, say that one of your MP3’s seems very loud, and another is much quieter. Speaking of the loud one, if you can see on the right that there is some red light, it is not a good sign – meaning that audio went above zero (so-called clipping), so you need to avoid it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="avoid clipping"
                ></p>
<p>(If you can not see your audio meters, just go to Window menu and choose Audio Meters).</p>
<p>So, here, our goal is to bring our audio clips around -3 – and for it, it’s possible to bring up and down the white line on the track, but it can be pretty time-consuming actually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-09.jpg"
                      alt="bring audio clips around-3"
                ></p>
<p>So a better way to do it would be next: click on the track and then right-click, find Audio Gain, and choose Normalize Max Peak to…:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on track"
                ></p>
<p>Max Peak is basically the loudest, highest peak in the audio clip. So, you can write in -3 and click OK, which will ensure the entire audio waveform will have the gain of it adjusted so that the max peak is at -3. You can proceed to the next track and carry out the exact same process on it too. Then, on Audio Meters on the right again, you will be able to see that both tracks (or more, if you have them) peak at -3. In case you have a lot of clips on the timeline, you can select them all, then go to Audio Gain and normalize all of their max peaks simultaneously, which will save you so much time and help you enormously!</p>
<h2 id="VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="VLC Media Player"></a>VLC Media Player</h2><p>VLC is a well-known media player, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and can stream from the most successful websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p>
<p>But there is another magic a simple media player can actually do - we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. It is very simple, so follow these steps:</p>
<p>You need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, click on Save.</p>
<p>What VLC does is just let adjust the general volume, leaving the specifics out of our control.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vlc"
                ></p>
<p>If you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu:</p>
<p>Find Tools and in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and you need to select All in Show settings – on the bottom left corner of the window. Then, navigate to Audio, and a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. You also need to check the checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-12.jpg"
                      alt="get more editing on vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the left panel, find Compressor and select it. From now, you can make the changes to the levels as you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-13.jpg"
                      alt="find and select compressor"
                ></p>
<p>Here, concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p>
<p>Attack time and release time can also be very helpful. You can play around with them set them to your liking, and see if it’s better sounding, because actually this will ensure that you have a fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, unexpected volume changes.</p>
<h2 id="MP3Gain"><a href="#MP3Gain" class="headerlink" title="MP3Gain"></a>MP3Gain</h2><p>MP3Gain is actually the only one in this list which is developed exactly for the task we are discussing in this article. It is an audio normalization software tool. The tool is available on multiple platforms and is free software. It analyzes the MP3 and reversibly changes its volume. The volume can be adjusted for single files or as album where all files would have the same perceived loudness. When applying the tool, there is no quality lost in the change because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding and re-encoding.</p>
<p>So, to use this software, go and download MP3Gain. Install and open it when it is ready. You will see that your program is absolutely empty and it has a lot of space inside, waiting for you to upload some file(s)…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp3gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can either choose adding files manually, with you choosing each of them, but let’s say you have an album (which would be more comfortable, needless to say) in which you want to change the volume of all MP3’s. So, in this case, you can choose Add Folder, and when the window opens, choose the folder full of your MP3’s – all your files will be added in the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose to add files"
                ></p>
<p>Now, find the Target “Normal” Volume above the files, and fill in the gap, if you will, or just use default dB. Then, click Album Analysis, and the process will start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="find and target normal"
                ></p>
<p>The software will show you the volume of each of the file, and then you will need to just click on Track Gain.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on track gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, wait for the process to be completed, and then you will see that the volumes changed for each of your files – so, it’s done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Movavi"><a href="#Movavi" class="headerlink" title="Movavi"></a>Movavi</h2><p>Powerful multimedia software for creating and editing videos – this is Movavi. It packs lots of video and audio editing power into a simple interface. On their official web-site, the program is described as: “An all-in-one video maker: an editor, converter, screen recorder, and more. Perfect for remote work and distance learning.” So, you can go and download the program, and learn audio normalization there very easily!</p>
<p>Install and open the program and then proceed directly to Adding Files. After having chosen your file, you drag and drop it in the timeline sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install and open program"
                ></p>
<p>If the audio is uneven, now double-click on the audio track, which will open the Clip Properties window. You will see the Normalize box, which you need to check. Doing this will even out the sound level for the whole track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>To save the result, click Export, choose the format, folder and name for your file, and then click Start, so your file can be exported.</p>
<p>So, it’s done – now you know a whole lot more about audio normalization, its types, why and when should we use it, and which are the 5 best free MP3 normalizers, along with the detailed guidelines on how to work with those tools to have your desired results. Let’s hope that you will be able to choose from Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi, and make your user experience so wonderful, and shareable!</p>

<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="noises are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>

                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>

<p>Here, concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p>
<p>Attack time and release time can also be very helpful. You can play around with them set them to your liking, and see if it’s better sounding, because actually this will ensure that you have a fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, unexpected volume changes.</p>
<h2 id="MP3Gain-1"><a href="#MP3Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="MP3Gain"></a>MP3Gain</h2><p>MP3Gain is actually the only one in this list which is developed exactly for the task we are discussing in this article. It is an audio normalization software tool. The tool is available on multiple platforms and is free software. It analyzes the MP3 and reversibly changes its volume. The volume can be adjusted for single files or as album where all files would have the same perceived loudness. When applying the tool, there is no quality lost in the change because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding and re-encoding.</p>
<p>So, to use this software, go and download MP3Gain. Install and open it when it is ready. You will see that your program is absolutely empty and it has a lot of space inside, waiting for you to upload some file(s)…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-14.jpg"
                      alt="mp3gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can either choose adding files manually, with you choosing each of them, but let’s say you have an album (which would be more comfortable, needless to say) in which you want to change the volume of all MP3’s. So, in this case, you can choose Add Folder, and when the window opens, choose the folder full of your MP3’s – all your files will be added in the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-15.jpg"
                      alt="choose to add files"
                ></p>
<p>Now, find the Target “Normal” Volume above the files, and fill in the gap, if you will, or just use default dB. Then, click Album Analysis, and the process will start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-16.jpg"
                      alt="find and target normal"
                ></p>
<p>The software will show you the volume of each of the file, and then you will need to just click on Track Gain.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-17.jpg"
                      alt="click on track gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, wait for the process to be completed, and then you will see that the volumes changed for each of your files – so, it’s done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-18.jpg"
                      alt="volumes changed for each files"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Movavi-1"><a href="#Movavi-1" class="headerlink" title="Movavi"></a>Movavi</h2><p>Powerful multimedia software for creating and editing videos – this is Movavi. It packs lots of video and audio editing power into a simple interface. On their official web-site, the program is described as: “An all-in-one video maker: an editor, converter, screen recorder, and more. Perfect for remote work and distance learning.” So, you can go and download the program, and learn audio normalization there very easily!</p>
<p>Install and open the program and then proceed directly to Adding Files. After having chosen your file, you drag and drop it in the timeline sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-19.jpg"
                      alt="install and open program"
                ></p>
<p>If the audio is uneven, now double-click on the audio track, which will open the Clip Properties window. You will see the Normalize box, which you need to check. Doing this will even out the sound level for the whole track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-20.jpg"
                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>To save the result, click Export, choose the format, folder and name for your file, and then click Start, so your file can be exported.</p>
<p>So, it’s done – now you know a whole lot more about audio normalization, its types, why and when should we use it, and which are the 5 best free MP3 normalizers, along with the detailed guidelines on how to work with those tools to have your desired results. Let’s hope that you will be able to choose from Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi, and make your user experience so wonderful, and shareable!</p>

Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Noise reduction</strong> is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.</p>
<p>The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do <strong>noise reduction in Audacity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity" >PCmag review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>
<li>If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>

<ul>
<li>Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.</li>
<li>When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.</li>

<ul>
<li>Now, click the PREVIEW button to hear the effect of your noise reduction settings. If you are not satisfied with the preview, you can adjust the settings bars until you achieve a good result.</li>
<li>You should also click on the RESIDUE radio button to hear the sounds that will be eliminated from your recording if your chosen settings are applied. This can be very useful as some settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. If you hear valuable audio content captured in the residue, adjust your settings accordingly. Try as much as possible to minimize the loss of valuable audio content.</li>
<li>Once you are satisfied with your audio preview and residue, click the OK button with the REDUCE radio button selected. This will perform the noise reduction effect on your audio recording.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Keep in mind that noise reduction is not a perfect process and strong noise reduction settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. Whether you choose to use Audacity or Filmora, try to strike the right balance between getting rid of background sounds and retaining valuable audio content.</p>

<p>For a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blogs.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/4-simple-tips-for-recording-high-quality-audio/" >recording to have good audio quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it needs to have as little background noise as possible. Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Noise reduction</strong> is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.</p>
<p>The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do <strong>noise reduction in Audacity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity" >PCmag review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>
<li>If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>
</ul>

<li>Once a new window labelled ‘STEP 1’ opens, click on the ‘GET NOISE PROFILE’ button. This creates the NOISE PROFILE which Audacity will use in the noise reduction process.</li>

<ul>
<li>Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.</li>
<li>When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.</li>

<p>The process of making a video has always been painstakingly long, and even though digital cameras and video editing apps that emerged in the last couple of decades have made this process somewhat easier, creating captions for videos you share online is still a time-consuming endeavor. Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>

<p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p>

Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>
