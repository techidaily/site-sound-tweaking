## "Advanced Techniques in Final Cut Pro: Embedding Waveform Diagrams with Live Audio Animation"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in FCP? (2 ways)

### 1\. Use Pixel Film Studios Audio Visualizer

With [FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2](https://store.pixelfilmstudios.com/product/fcpx-audio-visualizer-volume-2/) from Pixel Film Studios, users now have the ability to see up to 48 audio frequencies with full control over their left and right audio output, all within Final Cut Pro. Users have full control over smoothness, base scale, radius, angular offset, camera position, and animation, all with a single click of the mouse, all in Final Cut Pro X.

FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 has been professionally designed to work seamlessly inside Final Cut Pro X. As a title effect, FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 can be dragged onto media and previewed in real-time. With the published parameters found in the FCPX inspector, users have the ability to make further adjustments with just a few clicks of the mouse.

With the FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 preset pack, users have the ability to compose multiple presets and create their own visualizer every time. Users can choose from template layouts ranging from circles, lines, rectangles, and individual shapes to even an animatable drag zone. Then, within Final Cut Pro, users have total control over spread, color, location, rotation, angle, angle offset, and much more.

### 2\. Use audio waveform animation templates

It could be more convenient to select a few relevant templates directly than using other plugins. You get a full set of 21 templates, including titles, fonts, media streaming logos, sound effects, and colors, with this set of [Waveform Audio Visualization by Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/final-cut-pro-templates/waveform-audio-visualization-305379/) themes. You only need to pick the style you prefer, add your music, and post it with ease on your social media sites. This template is best suited for audiobooks, podcasts, and music videos. Of course, you must subscribe to the platform to download it.

## Part 3\. The best alternative to add audio waveform animation to video?

### Create Audio WaveformVideo in [Filmora Audio Visualizer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

To add audio waveform animation to video, there is a wide variety of applications. However, Filmora video editor is one of the greatest programs we suggest because you can alter any sound effects on this platform with only one touch. With audio keyframing and an integrated equalization, Filmora can produce unusual sound effects that enhance the audio recording.

Under “Effects” tab, you can find 25 types of audio animation in **Audio Visualizer**.

![audio visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-2.png)

Or you can directly open **“Elements > Recommended”**, and type “audio visualizer” or “music pack” to choose preset waveform animation elements.

Click the Play button in the Preview window and when you feel good about the results, click Export to download the video and your library and successfully share it on various social media platforms.

## Conclusion

Social media content creators, musicians, and VJs can produce stunning videos with any of the music visualizers we've listed in this article. As a professional video editing software, although Final Cut Pro can provide powerful editing features, the operation is more cumbersome and not easy to get started. So, I will recommend using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for the best experience.

If you are a content creator, you might already know the importance of having the right audio component in a video. For attaining a perfect balance between voiceovers and the background audio, the concept of "ducking" is implemented. I have come up with this post to help you know more about **audio ducking** and its importance. I will also include a detailed guide for [implementing audio ducking on a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in a stepwise manner. Let’s begin!

* [Part 2: When to Use Audio Ducking?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?](#part3)

## Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?

In nutshell, it is a process that “ducks” or lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears. For instance, let’s consider that we already have a background score in our video playing. When we would add a narrator’s voice or apply a voiceover, it would create a lot of confusion. Therefore, we implement the audio ducking process to lower the background audio and amplify the voiceover instead.

In most cases, it is achieved through a side-chain compression technique. A control channel is set up that enables the compression of one sound (the background) while amplifying another (the voiceover).

## When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?

Since the concept of audio ducking is pretty useful, it can be implemented in different ways during the video editing process. While you can apply the process to any video, here are some of the major instances where it is used.

#### Travel Vlogs

If you are a travel vlogger, you might already know how tough it can be to make yourself heard in a video. When there are too many background noises, your voice can be diminished. This is exactly where you can apply audio ducking to [decrease the background noise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and focus on your voice.

#### Make-up Tutorials

While creating make-up video tutorials, most of us use a background track to keep our viewers engaged. At the same time, you need to let them know about the process by speaking clearly. If you use audio ducking, then you can easily attain a perfect balance between both sounds.

#### Other Instances

Ideally, if you are creating any other tutorial video for your audience, then audio ducking can be useful. From making video game tutorials to coming up with video lectures on a crucial topic, the concept would come in handy time and time again.

## How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?

To implement audio ducking in your videos, you can use a reliable editing tool like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is a user-friendly and powerful video editing application that lets you "duck" the background sound and easily amplify voiceovers.

* Without undergoing any complicated process, you can implement audio ducking and even scale it (from 1 to 100) to attain the right balance in your videos.
* Filmora also offers tons of powerful audio features for video editing. It has a dedicated audio mixer that would let you split, detach, split, or mute the audio.

Apart from that, you can also go to the "Import" feature to add any other audio component to the project. Besides that, Wondershare Filmora also has a wide range of royalty-free audio files that you can easily add to your projects.

#### Step 3\.  Apply Audio Ducking to Your Video

After adding the second audio component, you can view it under the video timeline on Filmora. Now, you need to select the audio track you wish to amplify (like your voiceover) and not the track that already has a prominent volume.

![Apply Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-audio-ducking.jpg)

Once you have selected the audio you wish to amplify, right-click to get its context menu. Just select the “Adjust Audio” feature from all the available options.

![Adjust Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/right-click-adjust-audio.jpg)

This will launch a dedicated window on the screen with various audio options to apply. Go to the "Ducking" option here and enable the "Lower the volume of other clips" feature. You can also use a slider here to adjust how much you wish to lower the volume of other clips in the project.

That’s it! Once you have selected the value, click on the "OK" button. You can now preview the results on Filmora and check that the volume of other audio components has been ducked. You can later go to the “Export” option and save the project in the format of your choice.

After reading this post, I'm sure that you will know more about audio ducking and how we can implement it. Since many content creators encounter issues while working on their videos, audio ducking would certainly be a helpful feature. With an application like Wondershare Filmora, you can easily implement audio ducking on multiple files and further edit your videos like a pro!
