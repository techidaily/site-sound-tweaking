With many of these software, incorporating music is as simple as dragging a recording onto a timeline. You can use any of these software to add music to photo. You can easily upload audio to a photo if you grasp enough to use a smartphone. Picking music that will compliment your idea is the tricky aspect.

Quality is the foundation of art, and the only way to properly enhance your art is to practice. Don't be scared to take images of such things that most people overlook. Utilize things through music that most people aren't aware of to help your work thrive!
