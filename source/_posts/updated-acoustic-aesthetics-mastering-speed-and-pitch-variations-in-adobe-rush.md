Don't you just hate the sound of your own voice? As much as most of us have perfectly pleasant voices, regardless of how they sound when we hear them played back, sometimes we just don't have a good quality voice for video making.

Some people try to get around this by relying on the written word. While that's OK in some situations, it's just not as engaging as a high-quality voiceover. So, what can you do?

Many video makers have found great success in altering their voice ever so slightly. If they have a tendency to garble, slowing things down can help them get their point across better. Similarly, if they have a somewhat squeaky voice, adjusting the tone down a couple of notches can make them appear more authoritative.

Good video editing tools will allow you to play with the speed and pitch of your audio recordings, and not just voices either. Perhaps you want to jazz up a piece of music by playing it faster or add a playful element to your video by cranking the pitch of the music up to chipmunk levels.

Whatever you have in mind, being able to edit the speed and tone of audio in our videos opens up a world of possibilities for voiceover, music and more.

## Adjusting speed and pitch in Adobe Rush

We were excited to see what Adobe had in store for us as soon as they started talking about Rush. Branded a tool for the social media generation, it promised incredible usability, effortless integration with a variety of platforms and all the wonderful editing powers that Adobe are renowned for.

However, there have been more than a few oversights in what Adobe actually produced.

Users have complained that its slow, that rendering takes too long and that the software can be unstable. Worse than that, it seems that a number of key features are missing, such as being able to adjust the speed of video and to change the pitch and speed of audio too.

In short, if you're looking for a way to edit audio to be slower or faster, higher or lower in Adobe Rush, you simply can't. However, there is an alternative.

From the team at Wondershare comes a package known as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); an all in one video editing suite designed to do everything you need, and more. Within the capabilities of this software is the ability to edit your audio's pitch and speed, so that you can create the perfect auditory accompaniment to your movies and videos.

## How to edit audio in Filmora

Using the tools built into Filmora, you can change the pitch and speed of audio in just a few clicks. The function works on all imported audio, whether its attached to the video, recorded separately or is music that you've added to your library.

We'll talk you thorough how to use these editing tools, so that you know you've got an alternative to Adobe Rush.

The easiest way to edit the pitch of the audio in Filmora is to use the edit button on the control panel. Highlight the clip you want to edit, then use the button which features three lines with sliders.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audio-panel-in-filmora9.png)

Clicking this button will open up the edit menu, which allows you to edit video, audio, color and motion. Within the audio edit, you can fade the soundtrack in and out, can alter the pitch and can adjust the volume and equalizer settings too.

Within this menu, a handy tool will allow you to 'remove background noise' also. You can also set audio to fade in or out and can adjust the equalizer to suit the type of audio you're working with.

To change the speed of the audio along with the pictures, you can use the speedometer button above your track. You can also right click the clip and choose 'Speed and duration', or even use the shortcut ctrl+R to open the speed change menu directly.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-audio-speed-filmora9.png)

If you wish to change the speed of the audio without changing the video at all, you'll need to detach the audio from the video clip. This is simple; just right click the clip in question and select 'Detach Audio'. You can now edit the audio independently of the video.

Of course, if you're working on audio which is standalone, e.g. a voiceover or some music you want to play with your video, there's no requirement to detach it from any video clip.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll also discover the Audio Mixer, in the button with the musical notes on it. Clicking on this brings up an advanced audio adjuster, which can help you create a better audio quality for your video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-mixer-filmora9.png)

This allows you to adjust the specific settings of the videos you've uploaded, as well as any additional audio tracks you've added to your project. You can work in stereo or surround sound and can control the direction of all the audio within the mixer.

Wondershare Filmora has managed to not only provide a service Adobe has not, they've made it super easy too. Why don't you try out the free version of Filmora for yourself and see why we recommend this for all your video editing needs.

## Perfecting Sound Quality: Adding Lame to Your Audacity Setup

Lame for Audacity, one of the greatest mp3 encoders available for free download, since it's a bummer. Music & sound processing may be used with it. The editing and recording features are also a lot of fun to play with. Let us now begin our investigation into how lame for audacity may be downloaded and installed. Check out the Audacity website for additional tutorials on how to use Audacity.

Two files are included with the lame for audacity download. An mp3 encoding program for CD playback, Lame.exe, is the other one. Lame-enc.dll is the second (ICL 11,1). The ".regedit" Windows database has a copy of this file.

MPEG 1, 2, & 2.5 are now included in Lame's most recent release. a free encoding engine with additional layers of VBR ABR & CBR encodings If your computer has at least a Pentium 4 CPU, encoding will be much quicker. Noise interference may be minimized using the advanced audio settings.

## Download Lame for Audacity

![download-lame-for-audacity-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-for-audacity-poster.png)

Chrome OS does not support the most recent version of Audacity. It is possible to use Audacity on a Chromebook, even though it is not officially supported, by using the Chrome version for Linux Ubuntu. We wanted to be as helpful as possible in helping you get the most out of Audacity.

## How to install?

![lame-for-audacity-windows](https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-download-lame-for-audacity.png)

Installing Lame for Audacity is a simple process with no extra tools required. Right-click and choose "Install," then restart your computer. Continue to press the "Next" button until you've completed the task. A lame mp3 encoder may now be installed. However, here are the procedures to follow in order to utilize and begin the mp3 encoding process:

* Open Audacity and choose "Edit" from the drop-down menu.
* Select "Preferences" from the drop-down menu.
* Look for the "File Formats" tab, & then click on the "Find Library" button to locate the appropriate library.
* Look for the file "lame enc.dll," which may be found in "C: program file same for audacity," select it, and then click the "Open" button to go further.
* The "Preferences" menu in Audacity has a number of optional options. There is an option to modify the bit rate. Once you have finished adjusting the bit rate, you may return to the main Audacity page by clicking on the "OK" button.
* Select "File" and then "Export to mp3" from the drop-down menu.
* Save the file on your computer. You will be required to input the ID3 tags for the artist's name and the title of the music into the Audacity program. By clicking "Ok," the encoding procedure for the file into the mp3 format will begin.

## Lame for Audacity Windows

![lame-for-audacity-windows](https://images.wondershare.com/lame-for-audacity-windows.png)

You may either download or develop a suitable version of the Lame mp3 encoder, after which you can install it. Following installation, look for lame for audacity in the library choices. The majority of Linux distributions have a form of package manager that detects, downloads, and installs software packages from the internet for you. Once you've opened the package manager, look for Lame and then install it if it hasn't already been done so.

## Preferences for Library Resources

![preferences-for-library-resources](https://images.wondershare.com/preferences-for-library-resources.png)

Some distributions, such as the Ubuntu(Current) distribution, provide packages for Audacity, which includes mp3 encoding, and Libav, which is connected to the appropriate system libraries. It is not necessary to identify LAME or FFmpeg in the Audacity builds that have previously been packaged since there are no library choices for Audacity.

If you construct Audacity from source code, you may disable libraries' preferences by setting Audacity as follows: Disable > Dynamic > Encoding > Disable > Dynamic > Encoding > Disable > Dynamic > Encoding. Finally, create an instance of Audacity that is connected to the LAME system. Additionally, you may build FFmpeg or Libav on your own computer if you so wish.

## Can’t find MP3 Lame Library?

Most of the time, Audacity will automatically find the Lame Library. The actions outlined below are beneficial if the Lame option is available in Library preferences, & you also have a suitable version of Lame installed in a place other than the default one.

* Launch audacity and choose Edit > Preferences > Libraries from the drop-down menu on the left side of the screen.
* A Lame version number appears to the right of mp3 when it is exported from the mp3 Export Library. If LAME has been identified, you should export an mp3 and disregard the rest of the instructions. If, on the other hand, the mp3 Library displays "Not Found," go to the procedures below.
* To the right of the mp3 Library, click on the locating tab to open a search bar.
* When the "Locate Linux" dialogue box displays, pick Browse from the drop-down menu.
* A dialogue window with the text "Where is Limp3lame?" appears.
* I can't find Limp3lame. Please help. so. To exit Preferences, press 0 and hit Open, then OK and OK again.

Are you looking for an alternative to Audacity? It's also available to us! You may also want to investigate the Audacity VST enabler, which will allow you to utilize Audacity much more effectively.

## Conclusions

As an open-source audio editor, Audacity is extensively used, and mp3 is an audio codec. Many mp3 encoders are available online, even if they don't operate together. Using Lame with Audacity requires some effort, but it's worth it.

We also discuss Filmora's voice effects and how users may utilize the software to alter and enhance their voices. It is possible to re-voice video/audio and previously recorded voiceovers using Filmora. It's possible to use the Pitch option on the Timeline for video/audio and voiceover files. Make a video or recording sound different by altering its tone. Using Filmora, you can easily change the voices in your videos. Your viral should have a narration or a video accompanying it Allows you to modify your voice using the Changing Pitch option.
