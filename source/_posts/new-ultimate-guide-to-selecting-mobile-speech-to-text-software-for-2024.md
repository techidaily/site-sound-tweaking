Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

### 1\. [SpeechTexter (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speechtexter.speechtexter)

SpeechTexter is a free app available on the Google Play Store that you can use to create text notes, sms, emails, or tweets using your spoken words.

There is also the possibility of creating your own commands for specific punctuation, along with adding unique words into the app’s dictionary.

The software allows you to work with more than 60 languages, while the recognition percentage is around 95 percent for the English language. The app does require an internet connection to work at its best, as the accuracy is lower in offline mode.

### 2\. [Voice Notes (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SouthernPacificOceanFisher.VoiceToText%5Fmemo)

Voice Notes is available on the Google Play Store as a free download, but there are limits on how long you can record within the free version. Users who want access to the full version must pay the premium price of $3.

The app allows you to convert speech to text to create notes, reminders, and other documents. You can group documents based on categories, get support for up to 120 languages, and toggle between 20 different user interface languages as well.

Speechnotes does allow you to use the app offline, but accuracy is a lot better online.
