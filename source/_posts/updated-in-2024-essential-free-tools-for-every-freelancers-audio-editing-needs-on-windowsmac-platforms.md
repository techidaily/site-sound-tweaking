## Conclusion

Depending upon the availability of resources, all of the aforementioned approaches are great in their own way.

But considering that Wondershare filmora runs smoothly given the easiest interface and requiring least steps to perform audio extraction whilst being compatible with Mac and Windows both operating system, I would personally recommend this software for ease of accessibility and usability.
