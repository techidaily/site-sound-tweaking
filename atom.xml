Though many media players or speakers have volume control during playback, it still can be an annoying problem and it takes time to set it. And some downloaded files are rather low to listen to even you raise the volume to the maximum level on the computer. So it’s advisable to <strong>normalize the volume</strong> permanently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-volume.jpg"                      alt="Change Volume"                ></p><p>Thanks to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a professional video editing tool that makes it remarkably easy to increase&#x2F;decrease the audio level to a professional sound.

Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p><h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p><h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p><h4 id="2-Sonix"><a href="#2-Sonix" class="headerlink" title="2. Sonix"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://sonix.ai/" >Sonix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month</p><p>This feature-rich platform is designed to help storytellers tell their stories. You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.</p><p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p><h4 id="3-Amber-Script"><a href="#3-Amber-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Amber Script"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.amberscript.com/en" >Amber Script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $6 per hour of uploaded audio</p><p>Regardless of the pricing plan you choose, Amber Script lets you create text from audio files in 29 different languages. In addition, some pricing plans allow you to create text from both audio and video files, so you can easily make subtitles for your videos. Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you.

Omegle is designed in such a way to notice the drops that occur, if these drops are too many the system will automatically ban your account. That’s why it is important to a stable connection while you are trying to connect someone and avoid dropping the calls and chats when you are connected with someone. The system of Omegle will perceive you as a scammer or troll.</p><ol><li><h4 id="When-you-are-reported-by-another-user"><a href="#When-you-are-reported-by-another-user" class="headerlink" title="When you are reported by another user"></a><strong>When you are reported by another user</strong></h4></li></ol><p>One of the strange this that can happen to you on Omegle is being banned because of someone’s false accusations about you. If any other user reports you they will ban you straight away, without investigating the matter to find the truth behind the accusation. If someone doesn’t like you, your voice, your background, your slow internet connection, they can simply get you banned simply by reporting you. This system of reporting was designed to secure the safety of the users and help them avoid any kind of harassment and bully, but many users are using it in a negative and destructive way. To avoid such kind of ban, try to be as modest and as humble as you can with everyone you talk and get connected with.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Violating-Omegle’s-Terms-and-Conditions"><a href="#Violating-Omegle’s-Terms-and-Conditions" class="headerlink" title="Violating Omegle’s Terms and Conditions"></a><strong>Violating Omegle’s Terms and Conditions</strong></h4></li></ol><p>There are so many conditions of Omegle to follow, and sometimes it feels like an impossible thing to follow all those terms and conditions. They can ban you from Omegle if you are playing copyright music while a video call, if there is a movie or TV show being played in the background, you will be banned from Omegle. Another thing is to avoid being abusive with other users and behaviors.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-get-Unbanned-from-Omegle"><a href="#How-to-get-Unbanned-from-Omegle" class="headerlink" title="How to get Unbanned from Omegle?"></a>How to get Unbanned from Omegle?</h2><p>If you still got banned from Omegle after avoiding all the reasons that can cause a ban, then there is no need to worry. Multiple ways can help you get unbanned from Omegle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster.jpg"                      alt=" how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Use a VPN"></a><strong>Use a VPN</strong></h4></li></ol><p>The best and the most effective way to get unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want is to use a VPN. VPN helps you access Omegle from a totally different location, making you a different individual to use Omegle. It masks your IP address and provides you with a virtual and temporary IP address to get access to Omegle. But there is a small disadvantage of using VPN, which is slow speed. If you plan to have video chats, this slow connection may hinder this process and get you to ban again for several drops. But you can simply refresh the VPN and access Omegle from a different location and get unbanned again.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Wait-for-some-time"><a href="#Wait-for-some-time" class="headerlink" title="Wait for some time"></a><strong>Wait for some time</strong></h4></li></ol><p>If you don’t want to use any trick to Omegle and wait for a few days, you should. Because some bans only last for few days. Another thing that can happen after few days is the change of your IP by your ISP because it often gets refreshed after every few days, providing you with a new IP address and a way to access Omegle again without any external IP support.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Proxy-Service"><a href="#Use-Proxy-Service" class="headerlink" title="Use Proxy Service"></a><strong>Use Proxy Service</strong></h4></li></ol><p>It is no different than a VPN. It allows you to access the websites from an intermediary IP address making it your temporary IP address. This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn’t encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-a-Different-Network"><a href="#Use-a-Different-Network" class="headerlink" title="Use a Different Network"></a><strong>Use a Different Network</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Since the ban is not applied to the user, the IP address can simply be bypassed by changing the network you are using to access Omegle. Every network provides you with a different and Unique IP address. This could be anything, a mobile network, friend’s wifi, or public wifi. Changing the network can enable you to access Omegle immediately. Once your device is connected to a new network, your device is assigned to a new IP address making the Omegle access right away.</p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>The System that Omegle uses to ban its users is very strict and automatically bans users without getting into the matter and investigating it. So using Omegle and not getting banned doesn’t seem to be a possible thing. But one can avoid being ban as long as possible by avoiding all the reasons described in this article. But if you are ban, it can easily be accessed by using any of the above methods.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>On a platform like Omegle, it is common to be banned because of their strict rules and policies.

Another thing that can happen after few days is the change of your IP by your ISP because it often gets refreshed after every few days, providing you with a new IP address and a way to access Omegle again without any external IP support.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Proxy-Service-3"><a href="#Use-Proxy-Service-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Proxy Service"></a><strong>Use Proxy Service</strong></h4></li></ol><p>It is no different than a VPN. It allows you to access the websites from an intermediary IP address making it your temporary IP address. This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn’t encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-a-Different-Network-3"><a href="#Use-a-Different-Network-3" class="headerlink" title="Use a Different Network"></a><strong>Use a Different Network</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Since the ban is not applied to the user, the IP address can simply be bypassed by changing the network you are using to access Omegle. Every network provides you with a different and Unique IP address. This could be anything, a mobile network, friend’s wifi, or public wifi. Changing the network can enable you to access Omegle immediately. Once your device is connected to a new network, your device is assigned to a new IP address making the Omegle access right away.</p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>The System that Omegle uses to ban its users is very strict and automatically bans users without getting into the matter and investigating it. So using Omegle and not getting banned doesn’t seem to be a possible thing. But one can avoid being ban as long as possible by avoiding all the reasons described in this article. But if you are ban, it can easily be accessed by using any of the above methods.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="“Elevating-Audio-Accessibility-Three-Innovative-Tactics-for-Podcast-to-MP3-Conversion”"><a href="#“Elevating-Audio-Accessibility-Three-Innovative-Tactics-for-Podcast-to-MP3-Conversion”" class="headerlink" title="“Elevating Audio Accessibility: Three Innovative Tactics for Podcast-to-MP3 Conversion”"></a>“Elevating Audio Accessibility: Three Innovative Tactics for Podcast-to-MP3 Conversion”</h2><p>Converting podcasts to MP3 is simpler than many of you think.

Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is <strong>ducking sound</strong> that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren’t a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn’t needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this <strong>ducking music</strong> process, we have this post.</p><p>If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn’t a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing <strong>audio ducking</strong> in a step-wise way. With primary importance to the popular software <strong>OBS</strong> followed by a suitable alternative, let’s begin our article!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?"></a>Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?</h2><p><strong>OBS</strong> (Open Broadcaster Software) is free and open-source software reliable for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.13+. With countless features like real video&#x2F;audio capture, mixer, custom transitions, easy-to-use configurations, pre-source filters, VST plug-in support, noise suppression, and a lot more, you can accomplish audio ducking in OBS by adding a sidechain&#x2F;ducking compression filter. Thus, perform OBS audio ducking in a clean manner by lowering the audio automatically once OBS detects audio on the other audio source.</p><p>Does this magic of OBS audio ducking seem new to you? It will not be anymore as the below step-by-step manual will guide you through the process.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add video files</strong></p><p>Launch the OBS software on your system, and import the files into the workspace with the “File” menu. If you need to add voiceover from your microphone, you can click the “Start Recording” option under the main interface’s control section.</p><p>If the video plays on VLC in the background, it will appear on the mixer column.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose filter and compressor</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> icon next to the streaming video, click on it, and choose the “Filters” option from the drop-down.</p><p>You will reach the pop-up of the “Filters for Desktop Audio” whereby clicking on the “+” icon, choose the compressor option.</p><p>On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for <strong>ducking music</strong>, specify as “ducking,” and press “OK.”</p><p><strong>Step 3: Change the parameters</strong></p><p>You can now specify the values of the ratio, threshold, attack, release, output gain, and the ducking source, for example, “Mic” for microphone voiceover addition.</p><p>It’s complete. Yes, OBS audio ducking is over. Now you can check the video and alter the parameters if required after a preview.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS"></a>Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS</h2><p>Although OBS is preferable for being an open-source and free option with comprehensive abilities in video recording and live streaming strategies, the OBS ducking interface might seem a little unfriendly, making it difficult for newbies.

Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism"><a href="#1-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint. A complete step-by-step guideline has been shared for both Mac and Windows users on audio recording with PowerPoint. We also talked about 7 tips that will surely improve the quality of your slides.</p><p>By using the right and effective tool, you can still make creative slides without bothering to follow any tips.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism-3"><a href="#1-Minimalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-3"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-3"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-3"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them.

Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation-3"><a href="#7-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words-3"><a href="#Last-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint.

If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p><p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137222/26400" target="_top" id="2137222">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137222" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137222/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free.

The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> feature. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is pitch, and how does it work?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?"></a>Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?</h2><p>Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries.

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries.

The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Tongue-Tied"><a href="#3-Tongue-Tied" class="headerlink" title="3.

Tongue Tied <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997643/19272" target="_top" id="1997643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997643/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Drop"><a href="#4-Drop" class="headerlink" title="4.

Drop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.</p><h3 id="5-Rivers"><a href="#5-Rivers" class="headerlink" title="5.

Rivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn’t mean that it isn’t interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.</p><p> So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn’t mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don’t you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You’d be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-gain-more-followers-masterful-youtube-marketing-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Gain More Followers Masterful YouTube Marketing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/age-of-empires-iv-trouble-unlock-winning-fixes-to-get-your-game-running-smoothly/"><u>Age of Empires IV Trouble?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="“Top-15-Soundtracks-Without-Copyrights-for-Montage-Projects”"><a href="#“Top-15-Soundtracks-Without-Copyrights-for-Montage-Projects”" class="headerlink" title="“Top 15 Soundtracks Without Copyrights for Montage Projects”"></a>“Top 15 Soundtracks Without Copyrights for Montage Projects”</h2><p>The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer’s attention and communicate your message. We’ll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Copyright"><a href="#What-Is-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="What Is Copyright?"></a>What Is Copyright?</h2><p>If you are wondering: What is copyright? It’s a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.</p><p>Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.</p><p>If you’re caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you’ll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone’s intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.</p><p>Claiming you didn’t know about the artist’s copyrighted material doesn’t excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.</p><p>If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist’s consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.</p><p>The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.</p><p>For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.</p><h2 id="Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages"><a href="#Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages" class="headerlink" title="Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages"></a>Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages</h2><p>If you are looking for free montage music to keep your audience engaged with your content when viewing it, we have highlighted some great options.
