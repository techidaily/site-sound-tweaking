You can choose to edit the image by changing the placement. You can also use options like pan, zoom in, or out. Another thing you can do with the image is color-match the entire gif. You can breathe new life into your gif by adjusting the image's transparency.

You can change the duration of the image in a gif using the 'Duration' setting. You can also rotate the image under the transform panel. You can also flip the image horizontally or vertically. Explore the transition effects available on the platform.

##### Step 4 Add Audio

You can import an audio file from your device the same way you imported the image. Another option is to choose a soundtrack from one of the royalty-free sounds available in the Filmora library. It has a wide selection of audio available for use.

##### Step 5 Add Effects To Audio

There are many cool effects that you can use when inserting audio into your image. You can trim the audio to fit the gif. You can customize the point at which the audio begins. You can add voiceovers.

This video editor allows you to adjust the audio speed. It can't just increase or decrease the speed of the audio. You can also decide if the music should 'fade in' or 'fade out.' You can also adjust the volume of the audio you're playing.

##### Step 6 Export File

You can now export the file as an mp4\. If you choose to export the file as a gif, you will lose the audio, so please be careful when exporting the file. Also, a gif cannot be longer than 30 seconds, or it becomes a video.
