## Shifting Gears: Methods for Redefining Your Vocal Range

Some people prefer to hide their identity by changing their voices. The fact that every person has a unique and distinct voice makes it hard for anyone to find out if you are the same or a different person. The question here is that how can you change your voice?

Various ways could be used to get this done. The article understudy will talk about different practices to change your voice, and we will also discuss voice changers with effects to change your voice. If you want to learn about changing your voice, then let's get started!

#### In this article

01 [What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?](#part1)

02 [How to Change Your Voice in Practice?](#part2)

03 [How to Change Your Voice with Voice Changer Apps?](#part3)

## Part 1\. What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?

Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice. The environment has a significant effect on the way someone walks, talks, or even how someone acts on something. There are various factors upon which your voice sounds unique and special; some of these factors are briefly discussed below:

![factors making sound unique](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-your-voice-1.jpg)

### 1\. Gender

Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.

### 2\. Structure of Anomalies

The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person's voice. The structure of one's voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.

### 3\. Body Structure

Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.

### 4\. Height

Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.

### 5\. Heredity

Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.

## Part 2\. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?

There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.

The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:

### Change the Way you Talk

Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.

### Taking Care of Vocal Cords

Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.

### Vocal Exercises

There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.

## Part 3\. How to Change Your Voice with Voice Changer Apps?

As we mentioned earlier that there are various ways to change your voice. Now that we have talked about some factors to sound unique and some practices to change your voice, it’s time to learn about voice changer apps. So, are you ready to learn about voice changers with effects to change your voice?

### 1\. Gender

Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.

### 2\. Structure of Anomalies

The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person's voice. The structure of one's voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.

### 3\. Body Structure

Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.

### 4\. Height

Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.

### 5\. Heredity

Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.

## Part 3 Secret about adding audio to the photo?

If you’re looking to add audio to a photo in a straightforward manner, here's a tip for you than going complex. It’s because the software or programs available are highly problematic when it comes to better understanding. Thus, using the ideal program is the best way out (and a secret)!

We have to admit that customization is quite trendy among the young generation. Customizing a unique album is a cool thing, too.

A professional editing tool would be an ideal helper to do this (hence, the reason you’re here). While a great variety of music management software and video editors support adding audio to images, Wondershare Filmora stands out for its efficiency, simplicity, and robust capability.

To get started, consider a free trial copy of Wondershare Filmora

##### Step1 Import Media

Hit the "Import" tab to load your songs from ripped CDs or downloaded from the internet.

Then drag and drop your image in a format like JPEG, JPG, JPE, GIF, BMP, DIB, PNG, JFIF, TIFF, TIF to the media library panel. Now you'll consider using all the imported files displayed as thumbnails in the Media library.

##### Step2 Drag and Drop to add photos to audio

Drag songs and photos from the Media Library to the Timeline accordingly.

Filmora assists you in adding various photos to the audio. You can highlight the image and hover your mouse to the last section.

Click the "set duration" icon on the toolbar and set it to fit your music file's length.

Tips: You can zoom-out or zoom-in on the Timeline in the top right corner by dragging the timeline slider to find the ideal position easily.

Check the effect in the preview window after this. If possible, you can ramp up your creation, e.g., add captions, apply special effects, transitions, and even create a picture-in-picture effect.

##### Step3 Save Music with Photos

When you're satisfied with the outcomes, hit the Export tab.

Then, select MP4 under the format tab in the output window, or if you want to play the media on your phone, you can choose the device in the Export window and choose target devices among iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV, etc. Filmora will create a proper setting for phone device saving.

### Bonus tips

Rip audio from video: If you wish to extract audio from a movie trailer, film, comedy, TV show, etc., highlight the video file in the Timeline tab, right-click it and choose the "Audio Detach” tab, then you can eliminate the original video stream and save in a new MP3 format, and now you can freely add your images to the ripped music.

Or, you can delete the original audio file and add a new one.
