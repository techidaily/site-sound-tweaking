## **Recording Voice On Windows**

If you are using a pc or desktop, then keep in mind that most operating systems have their own default recording software that comes pre-installed. Most people don't know about them, and they rush for 3rd party applications for sound recording purposes. It doesn't matter if you use Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11\. Windows operating system also has its recorder app. It will be available on your system, and all you need to do is find it and use it. If you are unsure how to do that, then follow the steps given below.

1. Go to the search options of your windows and type "Voice Recorder" in it.
2. Click on the search button, and the voice recorder app will appear in the top searches.

![how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster2.png)

1. Just open the app, and a recording button will appear on the screen.

![how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster3.png)

## **Recording Voice On Mac**

If you are using Mac operating system, then it also has its recording app. Just follow the steps given below:

Recordings can be created using the built-in microphone, an external microphone, or a headset with a supported microphone. If you're signed in with the same Apple ID on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac, you can listen to your Voice Memos recordings on any of those devices.

1. Click on the Record button (or use the Touch Bar) inside the Voice Memos app on your Mac.
2. By clicking the Pause button, you can pause the video. You can resume the video by clicking Resume.
3. At the bottom of the page, click Done when you are finished.

## **Record Voice Using Audacity**

Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.

1. First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching "audacity windows 7", "audacity windows 8", "audacity windows 10", or "audacity mac" depending upon the operating system you are using.
2. Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.
3. Now you'll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be 'Windows WASAPI'. From the next choice to the right, choose 'Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)'.
4. It's important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers
5. Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time
6. Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.

## **Final Verdict**

That's how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows/Mac 10's built-in 'Voice Recorder' app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.

01 [Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect](#Part 1)

02 [Use Filmora to Add Background Music to Your Video](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-1.png)

That will download the entirety of the video in audio format only. All of this is free. Later in this article, we will show you how to cut and trim it.

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

If you are not satisfied with other scary sound effects or want something unique, you can make your sound effects. Initially, get a good-quality microphone with a pop filter for clear audio.

**Be Sure To Be In a Quiet Room with Padding:**

Connect the microphone to your computer make sure it is unmuted physically by pressing its button, as some microphones have a mute button on them.

**Make Sure the Microphone Is Unmuted In the Software:**

**Step 1:** Open a recording software, such as OBS Studio or audio recorder from Windows.

**Step 2:** Press record and make the sound effect you want.

**Step 3:** End the recording by pressing stop recording. You will now have recorded a scary music sound effect saved on your computer.

This method requires money for a good microphone, a pop filter, and padding.

### 3\. Getting Sound Effects from Free Websites

This option is attractive to many people, from beginners to people testing out the waters of audio editing. However, it should be noticed that the sound quality is not the best.

You can get free sound effects from websites such as Freesound.com or Soundeffectsplus.com.

**Step 1:** First of all, go to the website.

**Step 2:** Register an account

**Step 3:** Then search your desired sound effect

![search the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-7.png)

**Step 4:** Press download next to it.

Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.

### 4\. Buying Sound Effects

If you have money but not time to make your audio effects, you can buy sound effects off the internet. Usually, these sellers have excellent quality audio; they can even make specific sound effects tailored to your needs.

* Many websites sell sound effects, including the likes of – <www.prosoundeffects.com> and <www.soundsnap.com>.
* Both websites are famous among the audio effects community; soundscape even provides audio for Nickelodeon, Disney, Pixar, HBO, and Netflix.
* As per usual, you first register an account.

* These plans have different terms, such as 150 downloads per 6 months. Make sure of the times you will buy before you confirm the purchase.
* Then your search for the audio you want in the search bar
* Afterward, you click download. That’s it! You got it.

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)
