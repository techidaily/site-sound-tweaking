## "Most Popular Public Domain Songs for Visual Compositions"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.

## BeatBank: Your Digital Library of DJ Masterpieces

Party background music is a constant form of entertainment. It has been there for as long as we can remember. We tend to connect to a particular kind of DJ. Of all the different genres, most of the artists and genres are inspired by Rock n' Roll. Party background music adds life to all the stories and moments. But where and how to get it?? Let's find out.

## Part 1: How to Find the Best DJ Music?

Are you also on the lookout for electronic background music? Do you want to build a rocking collection without spending much? With the abundance of resources on the internet, DJs have a vast opportunity to discover and download sounds for free. Let’s have a look-

### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.

For example, apple music has playlists for nearly every genre, allowing you to keep updated with the latest tunes. Spotify's daily playlists are genre-based, and a fantastic blend of previously listened to songs and new tracks to compliment!

### Podcasts and Digital Radio

You may land up on new genres and impressive tracks in the process. This way, you can expand your search for good tracks. If you expose yourself to the digital radio on Apple Music or Spotify, you might find fantastic party sounds to add to your collection.

Independent and undiscovered artists sometimes offer their songs to use for free. Some established artists and labels also give out some freebies. If you have these resources up your sleeve, you won't have to worry about your budget. Take a look ahead at some of these below-

## Part 2： Where to Listen to Good DJ Music?

A good DJ can put you in a good mood. You can listen to good DJ on YouTube and other large streaming platforms like Sound Cloud and Amazon music.

### iTunes/Amazon Music

We all know about iTunes and Amazon. You'll find a vast range of tracks on them. There are high-quality files to listen to and use in your DJ sets. On a DJ controller, you can integrate your playlists quickly and easily.

### Beatport
