#### 2 Start adding your video to audio

 Drag and drop your video files to the video timeline. Before adding video to audio, your video files may need editing. You can use this video editor to add clips together, trim sections or change any other features.

 Then add the audio file to the audio timeline. Crop and arrange the music to make it fit your video. To further edit your audio file, double click it to set fade in/out effects, speed up/slow down it, and adjust volume in the pop up window.
