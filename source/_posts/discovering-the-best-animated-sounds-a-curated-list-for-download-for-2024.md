## "Audio Enhancement for Videos Without Breaking the Bank: Exploring Three Free Approaches"

The audio or music of video can dramatically affect our perception of a video – no matter whether it's a home movie, a commercial, or a video presentation. But what if all you have is silent footage or with just a crackled and distorted audio file that needs to be replaced, and at this time, you want to add a sound to the video?

To solve this problem, I humbly recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily **add audio to video**, record the voiceover directly and add it to video, or replace the original audio track (stream) with a new audio file.

In case you want to add music to video with some online tools, please leave a comment below so I can test some online solutions and share with you the best online tools to add audio to video free. I recommend Filmora because its requirement on the network isn't so high compared to the online tools.

Below is a creative way of adding sound effects to video.

## How to Add Audio to Video Easily

Now see the easy steps to add audio to video files or replace the original audio track with a new voiceover or music.

### Step 1: Add audio and video files to the program

After downloading and installing Wondershare Filmora, you can either click Import on the primary windows and select audio and video files from your computer or simply drag and drop audio and video files to the project media library. Filmora also features a free Audio Library, which provides different genres of music and sound effects.

You can preview it and add the proper audio to your video.

### Step 2: Add a new audio file to the video

Drag the audio and video files from the media library or Audio Library and place them on the respective tracks of the timeline, namely, place the audio file to the Audio Track. This way, the audio file(s) will be merged into the video.

![add audio to video free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-drag-music.JPG)

### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video. It's a fun way to add narration or complementary audio to video. To do so, click the Record button on the toolbar above timeline, the Record dialog will appear.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.

![add voiceover to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceover-filmora9.jpg)

### Step 4: Replace audio track of the video

This is similar to adding audio to video. Just an extra step is required: delete the original audio file. To do so, right-click the video you want to replace audio in it, and select [Audio Detach](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After that, delete the audio file from the track.

As described above, you can then drag and drop a new audio file from User's Album to the Audio track.

### Step 5: Adjust the audio file and be creative

Various audio editing tools are available: set volume, speed up, slow down, change pitch and add fade in/out effect. Double-click the audio file on the timeline to change the settings and drag the slide bar.

Hit "Return" to confirm the settings and go back to the main interface.
