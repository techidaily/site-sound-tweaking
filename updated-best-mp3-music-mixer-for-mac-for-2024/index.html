<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>

SoundHound"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melodis.midomiMusicIdentifier.freemium" >SoundHound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>SoundHound is simple to use and has a host of features that give you a complete music experience. It has over 300 million users. Switch on the app’s listening mode and discover any song or music playing around you. You can also identify a song or a tune stuck in your mind by just humming it to the listening mode and SoundHound will do the rest.</p>
<p>All your song searches are stored so that you can replay them later without having to search for them all over again. The app has real-time lyrics that let you sing along your favorite song. Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant). You can use this voice search to conduct all types of searches on this song finder app.</p>
<p>You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.</p>
<p>Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.</p>

Genius – Song Lyrics &amp; More"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US" >Genius – Song Lyrics &amp; More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Genius is more of a lyrics finder app than a song identifier app for Android. Its database contains lyrics of more than 1.7 million songs, and that database is entirely crowdsourced. Besides lyrics, you will get authentic information regarding the backstory of the songs on the database.</p>

                      alt="Genius — Song Lyrics &amp; More for Android"
                ></p>
<p>It is very simple to use the app. Just open the app, press the soundwave button and hold the phone near the source of the music. You will get lyrics and other information on that song in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Genius is run by the inputs of dedicated and obsessed music fans. So, if you fall into that category and want more to do with a song than just listening to it, then this is a must-have app for you.</p>

MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.musixmatch.android.lyrify&hl=en&gl=US" >MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The MusiXmatch is an app dedicated to bringing you the lyrics to any song you are listening at the moment. It has a handy floating lyrics widget feature that enables you get real-time lyrics on the track you are playing. The app has been downloaded more than 50 million times.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/musixmatch-lyrics-for-your-music.jpg"
                      alt="MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music for Android"
                ></p>
<p>What is best is that, the track can be playing on any music streaming app, and the floating widget of MusiXmatch will display the lyrics in sync with the song being played. Lyrics will appear embedded in YouTube music videos, whether they be in portrait or landscape mode.</p>
<p>It can also translate lyrics in real-time, thus enabling you to learn a new language while doing one of your favorite tasks listening to music. You can get the lyrics and translation of any song playing around you with a single tap. You can also find your favorite song by simply typing a single line of lyrics of that song.</p>
<p>The app also contains allied information on the identified songs. You can be a part of this app’s community and feed this database with music knowledge and information, lyrics and translations.</p>
<p>You can stream MusiXmatch on television via Chromecast, and the app is available on all Android wearable devices. A premium version of this app allows you to view lyrics offline, removes advertisements from the app, and enables a party mode where themes play in sync with the song lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.</p>
<p>Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).</p>
<p>To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.</p>
