Expressing ideas through music was never easy, and even today in the age of powerful digital audio stations like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) or [FruityLoops](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), producing original music requires a certain set of skills.

If you are looking for a quick way to make your own music online, then you should keep reading, because in this article we are going to take you through the ten best online music makers you should check out in 2021.
