### Record

After all, the hardware settings are done, and your track is armed, it's time to start the recording. For that, just tap on the Record button in the Transport toolbar. A yellow line in the timeline will indicate the end of the recording.

To end the recording, tap on the Stop button from the Transport Toolbar. Lastly, REAPER Recording Software will ask you to save the file. In case you don't want it, you can also delete it.

### Create and Manipulate Clips

Things like manipulation get a lot easier if you split the clips in REAPER. From the items menu, you have to select the option of Split Item on Cursor. This divides your clip into two clips on each side of the cursor. You can also remove the clips by going to the Items Menu. From there, you just have to hit the Remove Item option, or else, simply press the Delete key on your keyboard.

Removing clips will create a gap in the arrangement window that can be filled by dragging forward the remaining clip.

### Volume Adjustments – Normalize

By double-clicking on the item or by selecting 'Item Properties' from a right-click, you can normalize the item. A new window will appear as Media Item Properties, from where you have to locate the Volume Settings and then select the option of Normalize.

If your item is already loud, then nothing will happen, but if it is not, then the slider will change from 0.00 dB showing an increase in the volume. Lastly, hit the 'Apply' or 'OK' button to imply the changes.

### Fade in/out

With the Media Properties, you can also adjust a Fade in and a Fade out. For this, you simply have to set an end time for the Fade in, whereas a start time is entered for Fade out. Hit the 'Ok' or 'Apply' button to apply the changes.

From the Arrangement window, fades can be adjusted. For adjusting the fades, hover with your mouse over the red line. You will see a newly shaped cursor. Just drag on the timeline to play and adjust the Fade with this new cursor.

### Automate Changes

With REAPER, you can also automate changes in track parameters. We will guide about automation from Track Envelopes. From Track Control Panel, hit the Trim option. A new Envelopes window will open at this point from where you have to check the Volume box.

A new Volume Track will open up. Here, you have to set new Envelope points. That could be done by holding the shift key, right-clicking on the point, and then selecting Create New Point. A green circle will indicate the new point.

By dragging the Envelope point, you can also adjust the volume. Dragging it towards the top will increase the volume, whereas dragging it towards the bottom will eventually decrease.

### Finalize the Audio – Render

After all the above steps have been completed to set the order and adjust your desired volume, the last step comes to render your project file. For that, move to the File menu and select the 'Render' option. A window will be opened as 'Render to File.' Now, from the dropdown menu, select your desired Output Format.

Lastly, hit the Render 1 File button, and then REAPER will export your project. You can immediately listen to it by selecting the 'Launch File' option.
