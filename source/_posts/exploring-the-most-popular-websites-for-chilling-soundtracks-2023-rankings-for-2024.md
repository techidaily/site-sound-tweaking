You can make sound effects at your home with everyday objects to add to your film videos through a process called Foley. Here is a guide on how you can do it.

Start down the recording process; we break it into two categories: room acoustics and microphone selection.

**● Room Acoustics:**

Room acoustics are vital to capturing good recordings. You need a generally larger room to make room acoustics compared to an average size room for better results. Here we emphasize that your sound should have appropriate height, width, and depth. These attributes make the difference in recording high-quality and low-quality sound effects.
