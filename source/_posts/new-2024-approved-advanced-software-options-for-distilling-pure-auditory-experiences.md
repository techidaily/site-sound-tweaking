## Advanced Software Options for Distilling Pure Auditory Experiences

Background noise is the unwanted sound present in the background while recording audio. It diminishes the overall sound quality of the audio or video.

It will make it difficult to hear the recording and concentrate on the topic. Quite annoying, right?

Recently, technology has increased exponentially, and people are always on the computer, writing, or doing other tasks. People get tired of typing documents or clicking while playing a game at certain times. Or, some people are just too slow at typing to get any work done on time. This is where the **speech to text software** comes in.

Thanks to the advancements in technology, a speech to text software can be used to transcribe or convert audio to text. There is a multitude of such tools available online or as downloadable software.

Let us discuss some of the best tools to **convert audio to text**.

## Top Recommendation: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
