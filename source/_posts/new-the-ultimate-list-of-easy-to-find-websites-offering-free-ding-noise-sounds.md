### [**AI Vocal Remover**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For you to remove echo from your audio files with Filmora, you will need to utilize the AI Vocal Remover feature. The feature is specially designed to separate vocals and music from any song. However, it also allows you to remove other audio elements from your soundtrack, including echoes and wind. You only need to optimize your preferences, and the feature will handle the rest. Here are the few simple steps you will need to follow:

#### **Step 1: Launch Filmora and Create a New Project**

First of all, start the Filmora software on your desktop. Then click the “New Project” tab. This will open the Filmora editing space.

#### **Step 2: Import Your Soundtrack or Files**

Select the “Media” tab in the toolbar. This will allow you to edit the soundtrack files you want to edit in this project. Click on the “Files” icon and select the files to import. You can also drag and drop the files from your Windows Explorer or Mac’s Finder onto the Filmora media section.

Then click on the “Audio” and select “AI Vocal Remover.” Adjust the settings for DeReverb and Wind removal to remove echoes from your audio file. You can also explore Hum removal, AI Speech Enhancement, and Denoise to achieve optimal results.
