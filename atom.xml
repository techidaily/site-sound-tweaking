But what if you record noise-free audio instead?</p><p>If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.</p><p>If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn’t there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.</p><p>Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.</p><p>Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.</p><p>One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem?

You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don’t want to preserve.</p><p>Step2 Edit Audio</p><p>Select “Edit Audio” by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the “Audio” option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.</p><p>Step3 Remove Background Static</p><p>Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick “normal denoise” from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video. Once there, you can edit the audio and eliminate the noise by clicking on the Audio tab in the Editing panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-static-noise-8.jpg"                      alt="denoise in filmora"                ></p><p>Step4 Fine Tune and Export</p><p>Lastly, with Equalizer, fine-tune the sound to make it more natural.

But what if you record noise-free audio instead?</p><p>If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.</p><p>If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn’t there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.</p><p>Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.</p><p>Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.</p><p>One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem?

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism"><a href="#1-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7.

By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint. A complete step-by-step guideline has been shared for both Mac and Windows users on audio recording with PowerPoint.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism-1"><a href="#1-Minimalism-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-1"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-1"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-1"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-1"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-1"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation-1"><a href="#7-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Last-Words-1"><a href="#Last-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint.

In nutshell, it is a process in which the background sound of a clip is reduced and the voiceover is amplified. Therefore, with the help of sound ducking, we can focus on the dialogues without a noisy background track.</p><p>Lately, a lot of people have asked us about the process to do automatic audio ducking in <strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong>. Since it is a clip-based editing tool, it lacks a dedicated mixer to help us do FCPX audio ducking. Thankfully, there are third-party plugins and tools (like the <strong>FCPX AutoDuck</strong>) that can help us do the same. In this post, I will let you know how to do audio ducking in Final Cut Pro and its best alternative.</p><p>If you don’t want to use any plugins, see this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to sync in FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>If you have a video in which you have background music and a voiceover, then you can perform sound ducking in it. This will automatically enhance the quality of the voiceover and would mellow down the background music selectively. Sadly, the feature of audio ducking in Final Cut Pro has to be done manually as there are no instant automatic options in the tool presently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-1.jpg"                      alt="Audio Ducking Process"                ></p><p>Therefore, you can use any reliable third-party FCPX tool like Audified or AutoDuck to meet your requirements. For instance, let’s consider the example of FCPX AutoDuck, which is a paid macOS application. To perform FCPX audio ducking, you first have to export the music and voiceover as two dedicated files. Later, you can import them to FCPX AutoDuck to perform auto-ducking of the music.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files"><a href="#Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Export the Music Files"></a>Step 1: Export the Music Files</h4><p>To perform audio ducking in Final Cut Pro, you can first launch the application on Mac and open your project. Since there is no FCPX audio ducking option, you first have to export the music files.</p><p>For this, you can just go to the main menu on Final Cut Pro and select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Share</strong> &gt; <strong>Master File</strong>. This will help you explore and save all the media files from Final Cut Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-2.jpg"                      alt="Final Cut Pro Master Files"                ></p><p>Now, once the Master File window would be opened, you can go to the “Role” tab and select “Audio Only” as the output role. This will display a list of the background music and the voiceover file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-3.jpg"                      alt="Export Audio Tracks"                ></p><p>You can now select the files of your choice and click on the “Next” button to save them to any desired location on your Mac.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking"><a href="#Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking"></a>Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking</h4><p>Great! Now, you can just open the FCPX AutoDuck application on your Mac via its Application or Spotlight. You can just give it a project name and drag-and-drop the speaker (voiceover) and the music files here. If you want, you can also import a filler file of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-4.jpg"                      alt="FCPX AutoDuck Process"                ></p><p>FCPX will also let you select the level of music ducking from its dedication option. There are also different options to set up things like setting up the window or pre-roll for the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-5.jpg"                      alt="FCPS AutoDuck Options"                ></p><p>In the end, you can click on the “Duck” button and let FCPX AutoDuck perform automatic audio ducking on the files.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Insert-the-Modified-File-to-your-Project"><a href="#Step-3-Insert-the-Modified-File-to-your-Project" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Insert the Modified File to your Project"></a>Step 3: Insert the Modified File to your Project</h4><p>Once the FCPX audio ducking process is completed, it will generate an XML file. You can now just drag the XML file and drop it to your project in Final Cut Pro. Here, you can choose to select the XML file in the same project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-6.jpg"                      alt="Import XML in Final Cut Pro"                ></p><p>You can now copy the modified music clip, go to the timeline, and paste it at the starting of the video. Here, you can just mute the previous music clip and let the auto-duck audio play instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-7.jpg"                      alt="Audio Ducking Media Final Cut Pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-FCPX-Alternative-for-Mac-to-Perform-Automatic-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-FCPX-Alternative-for-Mac-to-Perform-Automatic-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best FCPX Alternative for Mac to Perform Automatic Audio Ducking"></a>Part 2: The Best FCPX Alternative for Mac to Perform Automatic Audio Ducking</h2><p>As you can see, it is pretty tough to do audio ducking in Final Cut Pro as there is no automatic feature in the tool. Therefore, you can consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to perform automatic sound ducking and save your time. It is an inbuilt feature in Filmora that would perform auto-ducking instantly, and you can also mark the level of ducking in the video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Ideally, you can perform audio ducking on voiceover or another soundtrack in Wondershare Filmora. To perform music ducking via Wondershare Filmora on Mac, you can follow these steps:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Import-the-Video-Clip-or-Record-Your-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Import-the-Video-Clip-or-Record-Your-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Import the Video Clip or Record Your Audio"></a>Step 1: Import the Video Clip or Record Your Audio</h4><p>To begin with, just launch Wondershare Filmora on your Mac and just drag-and-drop your media files to the application.

The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly.

It is used for various purposes, like audio recording, music creation, and audio file editing. It also allows you to increase and decrease the volume of audio files.</p><p>You may also apply the modifications to multiple files at once, rather than one at a time. Check out the instructions below to learn how to change the volume of multiple audio files:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the <strong>Import</strong> option from the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then pick the <strong>Audio</strong> option. Browse to your audio files, choose all of them, and then click the Open option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-to-audacity.jpg"                      alt="import audio files to audacity"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To select all the files, press <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>, click on the <strong>Effect</strong> option in the menu bar and pick <strong>Amplify.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-multiple-audio-files-audacity.jpg"                      alt="select multiple audio files audacity"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, either enter the value in the text box next to the <strong>Amplification Decibels</strong> tab or use the slider under it.

Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.</p><h3 id="Amplify"><a href="#Amplify" class="headerlink" title="Amplify"></a><strong>Amplify</strong></h3><p>It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect’s name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.</p><p>Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="amplify audio audacity"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Normalize"><a href="#Normalize" class="headerlink" title="Normalize"></a><strong>Normalize</strong></h3><p>The meaning of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >normalizing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.</p><p>As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.</p><p>By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-normalize-interface.jpg"                      alt="audacity normalize interface"                ></p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Normalizers for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Differences"><a href="#Differences" class="headerlink" title="Differences"></a><strong>Differences</strong></h3><p>To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.</p><p>When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market.

Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.</p><h3 id="Amplify-1"><a href="#Amplify-1" class="headerlink" title="Amplify"></a><strong>Amplify</strong></h3><p>It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect’s name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.</p><p>Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="amplify audio audacity"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Normalize-1"><a href="#Normalize-1" class="headerlink" title="Normalize"></a><strong>Normalize</strong></h3><p>The meaning of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >normalizing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.</p><p>As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.</p><p>By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard.

Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.</p><p>When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing.

Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> feature. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is pitch, and how does it work?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?"></a>Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?</h2><p>Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries.

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched.

Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is <strong>ducking sound</strong> that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren’t a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn’t needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this <strong>ducking music</strong> process, we have this post.</p><p>If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn’t a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing <strong>audio ducking</strong> in a step-wise way. With primary importance to the popular software <strong>OBS</strong> followed by a suitable alternative, let’s begin our article!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?"></a>Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?</h2><p><strong>OBS</strong> (Open Broadcaster Software) is free and open-source software reliable for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.13+. With countless features like real video&#x2F;audio capture, mixer, custom transitions, easy-to-use configurations, pre-source filters, VST plug-in support, noise suppression, and a lot more, you can accomplish audio ducking in OBS by adding a sidechain&#x2F;ducking compression filter. Thus, perform OBS audio ducking in a clean manner by lowering the audio automatically once OBS detects audio on the other audio source.</p><p>Does this magic of OBS audio ducking seem new to you? It will not be anymore as the below step-by-step manual will guide you through the process.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add video files</strong></p><p>Launch the OBS software on your system, and import the files into the workspace with the “File” menu. If you need to add voiceover from your microphone, you can click the “Start Recording” option under the main interface’s control section.</p><p>If the video plays on VLC in the background, it will appear on the mixer column.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose filter and compressor</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> icon next to the streaming video, click on it, and choose the “Filters” option from the drop-down.</p><p>You will reach the pop-up of the “Filters for Desktop Audio” whereby clicking on the “+” icon, choose the compressor option.</p><p>On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for <strong>ducking music</strong>, specify as “ducking,” and press “OK.”</p><p><strong>Step 3: Change the parameters</strong></p><p>You can now specify the values of the ratio, threshold, attack, release, output gain, and the ducking source, for example, “Mic” for microphone voiceover addition.</p><p>It’s complete. Yes, OBS audio ducking is over. Now you can check the video and alter the parameters if required after a preview.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS"></a>Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS</h2><p>Although OBS is preferable for being an open-source and free option with comprehensive abilities in video recording and live streaming strategies, the OBS ducking interface might seem a little unfriendly, making it difficult for newbies.

To convert the text into voice in Windows, it is necessary to use an external service provider. We know that Siri voice generator is the best text-to-voice converter to use while converting your text to audio. But unfortunately, Apple hasn’t introduced any website for their Siri Voice Generator. This makes it difficult for the users of the Windows operating system to convert their text into a voice using Siri. But there is no need to be worried, we are here to help you solve this problem. We have found some of the best text-to-voice converter websites that will provide you with the same experience of Siri and its features. There are multiple websites out there that claim to generate the best Siri voices. But it is difficult to choose the best one from all those platforms. We are going to provide you with the best alternative of Siri that can provide you with the same features and qualities as Siri. One of the best alternatives for Siri is Google text to Speech.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech"><strong>Google Text-to-Speech</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-speech-to-text-poster.png"                      alt="google-speech-to-text-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Price:</strong> Chart Attached</p><p><strong>Language Coverage:</strong> 40+</p><p><strong>Voice Choices:</strong> 220+</p><p>There is no doubt in the fact that there is no platform or website that can take place of Siri. But Google’s Text-to-Speech service is something worth considering as an alternative to Siri. With its service, Google provides its users with a wide variety of language choices to choose from to fulfill the need of every user, no matter where the user lives. The best thing about Google Text-to-Speech is its extensive range of voice choices. You have more than 220 voices to choose from for your content. There is no need to make all your content sound similar. You can always change the voice of your content to match it with the content type and its audience. Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind’s speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can’t be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>PACKAGE</strong></th><th><strong>PRICE</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Standard Voices</strong></td><td>$4.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>WaveNet Voices</strong></td><td>$16.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Just like Google Text-to-Speech, there various other amazing platforms that provide you with the same services like Siri.
