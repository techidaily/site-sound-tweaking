Since most of the anime series are in Japanese, they are dubbed in different languages for their global audience. Though, anime dubbing is an art in itself as it takes a lot of effort to provide a seamless entertainment experience to others. In this post, I’m going to make you familiar with the process that goes behind <strong>anime dubbing</strong> and how you can master it in no time.</p>

<p>There are tons of anime out there, but most of them are originally made in Japanese. To make them appealing to an international audience, the concepts of dubbing and subbing are implemented. In subbing, we simply add subtitles to the scene by placing its strip at the bottom, which is comparatively easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Anime dubbing is a more complex process in which the original soundtrack in Japanese is first removed from the video. Now, a script is designed for the other language (like English) in which the video has to be dubbed. Afterward, voiceover artists would match the dialogues with the original pace of the video to attain flawless dubbing results. Now, the audience of the second language can also watch the anime with the dubbed soundtrack instead of the Japanese.</p>
<p>In some cases, even after dubbing, subtitles are also added in post-production to get better results.</p>

<p>Anime is an art-form and hence, it is should be treated creatively when transitioning into different cultures. The first generation of anime traces to the 1910s in Japan while they became mainstream with Astro Boy that was a hit not only in Japan but in the US as well. Needless to say, the anime industry has grown drastically with over $17 billion worth worldwide.</p>
<p>That’s why it has become more important than ever to focus on anime dubbing and make the content appealing to a vast audience. Too many times, while dubbing, the original nature of a character is lost due to the improper voice transition. Sometimes, there are edits in the script to match the pace of the scene that ends up changing the meaning drastically.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make sure the true essence of the anime is maintained, the concept of voice interpretation is implemented. In this, voiceover artists are taught about their characters and their nature. Instead of bringing their own flair while recording, they are encouraged to voice their characters instead.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing"><a href="#What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing" class="headerlink" title="What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?"></a>What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?</h2><p>Now when you know the importance of anime dubbing, let’s get to know about the process in detail. Although the overall process can be implemented differently in various countries and studios, the following steps are mostly followed by professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Transitioning and Translation</strong></p>
<p>This is the foundation of anime dubbing as it helps us in scriptwriting and voiceover. Firstly, the anime is studied by the team, which includes native Japanese experts. For instance, if the anime is about Japanese history or its pop culture, then an expert from the related field is asked to join.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the dialogues are transcribed and further translated by professionals. To make sure that no cultural norms are lost in the process, a group of people is invited to work on this. If the anime is about pop culture, then it can be a bit tough since some dialogues might lose the original meaning in the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Scripting and Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>A mere translation of the anime is not enough as it is needed to fit the scene and should have a flawless transition. For this, scriptwriters take the translated document (for instance, Japanese to English translated version) and start developing a script for that. They will watch the scene simultaneously and would work with voiceover artists as well. In this way, we can avoid any delay or rapid movement between the picture and voiceover audio.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new dialogues should be spoken in the same way so that the original speech and the voiceover should be matched.</li>
<li>A lot of sentences have to be reconstructed entirely since Japanese grammar is pretty different than English. Sometimes, a single word in Japanese might mean a whole sentence in English. This means we need to write the script while matching the pace of the scene and keeping the meaning intact (which can be pretty challenging).</li>
<li>Scriptwriters need to focus on the way a sentence is delivered and conveyed. If you are not careful, then you will lose out on certain nuances.</li>
<li>To get an ideal script, you might need to watch the anime and deliver your dialogues back-and-forth. Writers are encouraged to be more adaptive and keep the cultural knowledge of their audience in mind as well.</li>
<li>If the anime is deeply rooted in Japanese cultural norms that you know your audience won’t understand, then you can abandon it while still being faithful to the original material. For instance, Shin-chan had too many Japanese norms and thus it was re-written in English to include more local terms.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Step 3: Recording and Finishing</strong></p>
<p>After completing the scriptwriting, recording artists work on it to give it a final touch. Although it is recommended for all recording artists to do their voice work together for a seamless amalgamation, sometimes they record their dialogues separately as well.</p>
<p>The recording artists are encouraged to do their bit of research and are made familiar with the anime. During the recording process, artists focus on the “matching flap” movement, which means their dialogues should match with the movement of their character’s lips. For this, they can fasten or slow their speed of dialogue delivery or add bits and pieces in between to give it a personal character.</p>
<p>While it is not possible to be entirely accurate and match the pace, artists try their best by looking at the video while delivering their dialogues. Some mistakes and flubs are bound to happen in the process, but that is what makes anime dubbing so hilarious and creative.</p>

<p>In most of the cases, the process is pretty enjoyable if the artists and writers are fans of anime. Yes, the process can be a bit tedious, but that is the demand of this challenging profession altogether.</p>
<p>Michael Lindsay, who was widely appreciated for his work in the Marmalade Boy, admits how tough the job can be. It requires a lot of rework and the voiceover artists need to go back-and-forth to get the right pace.</p>
<p>Olivia Venegas, who has been a part of the anime dubbing industry for over a decade, admits how the process has changed. Now, production houses are more focused on creating a “localized” version of the anime that their audience can understand instead of keeping it rigid to their original material.</p>

<ul>
<li>To start with, do your bit of research and make sure you understand the Japanese culture. If the anime is about history or a cultural phenomenon, then get to know about it so that you won’t miss any nuance.</li>
<li>If you are a voiceover artist, then sit with the scriptwriter during the translation and writing process. This will help you understand their writing process and you can also give suggestions regarding voiceover.</li>
<li>Focus on your speech and the pace while recording every word. At times, we are needed to eat some words or have to stretch them to match with the movement of the character’s lips.</li>
<li>Try not to be overdramatic and don’t “act” too much while recording. Consider anime characters as real humans with organic feelings. If you over-do it, then it can become funny and take away the gravity of the scene.</li>
<li>Apart from your usual research, also watch the body language of your characters and their expressions. You can try to take the same posture and position while delivering any dialogue for a better anime dubbing experience.</li>
<li>Most importantly, let the transition be more organic and feel free to make some creative choices to own the character. Remember, your aim is to be the character and not let the character become you.</li>
<li>Lastly, keep in mind your audience while dubbing and make sure that they should relate to the nuances and cultural slangs you have included. While it is suggested to stick to the source material, you can bend it keeping the mindset of your target audience.</li>

<p>There are tons of anime out there, but most of them are originally made in Japanese. To make them appealing to an international audience, the concepts of dubbing and subbing are implemented. In subbing, we simply add subtitles to the scene by placing its strip at the bottom, which is comparatively easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Anime dubbing is a more complex process in which the original soundtrack in Japanese is first removed from the video. Now, a script is designed for the other language (like English) in which the video has to be dubbed. Afterward, voiceover artists would match the dialogues with the original pace of the video to attain flawless dubbing results. Now, the audience of the second language can also watch the anime with the dubbed soundtrack instead of the Japanese.</p>
<p>In some cases, even after dubbing, subtitles are also added in post-production to get better results.</p>

<p>Anime is an art-form and hence, it is should be treated creatively when transitioning into different cultures. The first generation of anime traces to the 1910s in Japan while they became mainstream with Astro Boy that was a hit not only in Japan but in the US as well. Needless to say, the anime industry has grown drastically with over $17 billion worth worldwide.</p>
<p>That’s why it has become more important than ever to focus on anime dubbing and make the content appealing to a vast audience. Too many times, while dubbing, the original nature of a character is lost due to the improper voice transition. Sometimes, there are edits in the script to match the pace of the scene that ends up changing the meaning drastically.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make sure the true essence of the anime is maintained, the concept of voice interpretation is implemented. In this, voiceover artists are taught about their characters and their nature. Instead of bringing their own flair while recording, they are encouraged to voice their characters instead.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?"></a>What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?</h2><p>Now when you know the importance of anime dubbing, let’s get to know about the process in detail. Although the overall process can be implemented differently in various countries and studios, the following steps are mostly followed by professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Transitioning and Translation</strong></p>
<p>This is the foundation of anime dubbing as it helps us in scriptwriting and voiceover. Firstly, the anime is studied by the team, which includes native Japanese experts. For instance, if the anime is about Japanese history or its pop culture, then an expert from the related field is asked to join.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the dialogues are transcribed and further translated by professionals. To make sure that no cultural norms are lost in the process, a group of people is invited to work on this. If the anime is about pop culture, then it can be a bit tough since some dialogues might lose the original meaning in the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Scripting and Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>A mere translation of the anime is not enough as it is needed to fit the scene and should have a flawless transition. For this, scriptwriters take the translated document (for instance, Japanese to English translated version) and start developing a script for that. They will watch the scene simultaneously and would work with voiceover artists as well. In this way, we can avoid any delay or rapid movement between the picture and voiceover audio.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new dialogues should be spoken in the same way so that the original speech and the voiceover should be matched.</li>
<li>A lot of sentences have to be reconstructed entirely since Japanese grammar is pretty different than English. Sometimes, a single word in Japanese might mean a whole sentence in English. This means we need to write the script while matching the pace of the scene and keeping the meaning intact (which can be pretty challenging).</li>
<li>Scriptwriters need to focus on the way a sentence is delivered and conveyed. If you are not careful, then you will lose out on certain nuances.</li>
<li>To get an ideal script, you might need to watch the anime and deliver your dialogues back-and-forth. Writers are encouraged to be more adaptive and keep the cultural knowledge of their audience in mind as well.</li>

<p>There are tons of anime out there, but most of them are originally made in Japanese. To make them appealing to an international audience, the concepts of dubbing and subbing are implemented. In subbing, we simply add subtitles to the scene by placing its strip at the bottom, which is comparatively easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Anime dubbing is a more complex process in which the original soundtrack in Japanese is first removed from the video. Now, a script is designed for the other language (like English) in which the video has to be dubbed. Afterward, voiceover artists would match the dialogues with the original pace of the video to attain flawless dubbing results. Now, the audience of the second language can also watch the anime with the dubbed soundtrack instead of the Japanese.</p>
<p>In some cases, even after dubbing, subtitles are also added in post-production to get better results.</p>

<p>Anime is an art-form and hence, it is should be treated creatively when transitioning into different cultures. The first generation of anime traces to the 1910s in Japan while they became mainstream with Astro Boy that was a hit not only in Japan but in the US as well. Needless to say, the anime industry has grown drastically with over $17 billion worth worldwide.</p>
<p>That’s why it has become more important than ever to focus on anime dubbing and make the content appealing to a vast audience. Too many times, while dubbing, the original nature of a character is lost due to the improper voice transition. Sometimes, there are edits in the script to match the pace of the scene that ends up changing the meaning drastically.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make sure the true essence of the anime is maintained, the concept of voice interpretation is implemented. In this, voiceover artists are taught about their characters and their nature. Instead of bringing their own flair while recording, they are encouraged to voice their characters instead.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing-3"><a href="#What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?"></a>What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?</h2><p>Now when you know the importance of anime dubbing, let’s get to know about the process in detail. Although the overall process can be implemented differently in various countries and studios, the following steps are mostly followed by professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Transitioning and Translation</strong></p>
<p>This is the foundation of anime dubbing as it helps us in scriptwriting and voiceover. Firstly, the anime is studied by the team, which includes native Japanese experts. For instance, if the anime is about Japanese history or its pop culture, then an expert from the related field is asked to join.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the dialogues are transcribed and further translated by professionals. To make sure that no cultural norms are lost in the process, a group of people is invited to work on this. If the anime is about pop culture, then it can be a bit tough since some dialogues might lose the original meaning in the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Scripting and Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>A mere translation of the anime is not enough as it is needed to fit the scene and should have a flawless transition. For this, scriptwriters take the translated document (for instance, Japanese to English translated version) and start developing a script for that. They will watch the scene simultaneously and would work with voiceover artists as well. In this way, we can avoid any delay or rapid movement between the picture and voiceover audio.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new dialogues should be spoken in the same way so that the original speech and the voiceover should be matched.</li>
<li>A lot of sentences have to be reconstructed entirely since Japanese grammar is pretty different than English. Sometimes, a single word in Japanese might mean a whole sentence in English. This means we need to write the script while matching the pace of the scene and keeping the meaning intact (which can be pretty challenging).</li>
<li>Scriptwriters need to focus on the way a sentence is delivered and conveyed. If you are not careful, then you will lose out on certain nuances.</li>
<li>To get an ideal script, you might need to watch the anime and deliver your dialogues back-and-forth. Writers are encouraged to be more adaptive and keep the cultural knowledge of their audience in mind as well.</li>
<li>If the anime is deeply rooted in Japanese cultural norms that you know your audience won’t understand, then you can abandon it while still being faithful to the original material. For instance, Shin-chan had too many Japanese norms and thus it was re-written in English to include more local terms.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Step 3: Recording and Finishing</strong></p>
<p>After completing the scriptwriting, recording artists work on it to give it a final touch. Although it is recommended for all recording artists to do their voice work together for a seamless amalgamation, sometimes they record their dialogues separately as well.</p>
<p>The recording artists are encouraged to do their bit of research and are made familiar with the anime. During the recording process, artists focus on the “matching flap” movement, which means their dialogues should match with the movement of their character’s lips. For this, they can fasten or slow their speed of dialogue delivery or add bits and pieces in between to give it a personal character.</p>
<p>While it is not possible to be entirely accurate and match the pace, artists try their best by looking at the video while delivering their dialogues. Some mistakes and flubs are bound to happen in the process, but that is what makes anime dubbing so hilarious and creative.</p>
<h2 id="Is-Anime-Dubbing-Enjoyable-or-Painful-3"><a href="#Is-Anime-Dubbing-Enjoyable-or-Painful-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Anime Dubbing Enjoyable or Painful?"></a>Is Anime Dubbing Enjoyable or Painful?</h2><p>This is something that a lot of anime fans would like to ask voiceover professionals. Well, it would be subjective and depend on the anime as well as the professionals working on it.</p>
<p>In most of the cases, the process is pretty enjoyable if the artists and writers are fans of anime. Yes, the process can be a bit tedious, but that is the demand of this challenging profession altogether.</p>
<p>Michael Lindsay, who was widely appreciated for his work in the Marmalade Boy, admits how tough the job can be. It requires a lot of rework and the voiceover artists need to go back-and-forth to get the right pace.</p>
<p>Olivia Venegas, who has been a part of the anime dubbing industry for over a decade, admits how the process has changed. Now, production houses are more focused on creating a “localized” version of the anime that their audience can understand instead of keeping it rigid to their original material.</p>
<p>Overall, the change in the anime dubbing process and the presence of better technology has certainly made it more fun and less painful.</p>
<h2 id="Anime-Dubbing-Tips-for-Beginners-3"><a href="#Anime-Dubbing-Tips-for-Beginners-3" class="headerlink" title="Anime Dubbing Tips for Beginners"></a>Anime Dubbing Tips for Beginners</h2><p>If you are just starting your career in anime dubbing and would like to improve your work, then consider these expert tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, do your bit of research and make sure you understand the Japanese culture. If the anime is about history or a cultural phenomenon, then get to know about it so that you won’t miss any nuance.</li>
<li>If you are a voiceover artist, then sit with the scriptwriter during the translation and writing process. This will help you understand their writing process and you can also give suggestions regarding voiceover.</li>
<li>Focus on your speech and the pace while recording every word. At times, we are needed to eat some words or have to stretch them to match with the movement of the character’s lips.</li>
<li>Try not to be overdramatic and don’t “act” too much while recording. Consider anime characters as real humans with organic feelings. If you over-do it, then it can become funny and take away the gravity of the scene.</li>
<li>Apart from your usual research, also watch the body language of your characters and their expressions. You can try to take the same posture and position while delivering any dialogue for a better anime dubbing experience.</li>
<li>Most importantly, let the transition be more organic and feel free to make some creative choices to own the character. Remember, your aim is to be the character and not let the character become you.</li>
<li>Lastly, keep in mind your audience while dubbing and make sure that they should relate to the nuances and cultural slangs you have included. While it is suggested to stick to the source material, you can bend it keeping the mindset of your target audience.</li>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p>
<h3 id="1-Google-App"><a href="#1-Google-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p>
<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>
<p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p>
<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>

<p>Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).</p>
<p>To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.</p>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>

<p>The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.</p>
<p>Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).</p>
<p>To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.</p>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021-3"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p>
<h3 id="1-Google-App-3"><a href="#1-Google-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p>
<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>
<p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p>
<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shazam-3"><a href="#2-Shazam-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Shazam"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android" >Shazam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds. You will get to find and listen to your desired song and get all related information like lyrics, videos, and artist’s profile.</p>

<p>You can listen to the song on this song identifier app or add the song to your Spotify or Apple Music, or Google Play Music playlist. Shazam also allows you to watch music videos from YouTube and Apple Music.</p>
<p>The Pop-Up feature of Shazam is one of its best features. It enables you to identify music on any app like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. Besides, you can use the app offline and in the background to continue identifying songs even though the app is not in use.</p>
<p>The app will also notify you about your country’s and city’s current music scene, recommend playlists according to your tastes and lets you share songs on social media. The Shazam app has been downloaded over 200 million times in 150+ countries. This should convince you of the app’s credibility.</p>
<p>In 2018, Apple Inc. completed acquiring Shazam for $400 million dollars. Since, then Shazam comes integrated with iOS (version 14.2 and higher).</p>

It has over 300 million users. Switch on the app’s listening mode and discover any song or music playing around you. You can also identify a song or a tune stuck in your mind by just humming it to the listening mode and SoundHound will do the rest.</p>
<p>All your song searches are stored so that you can replay them later without having to search for them all over again. The app has real-time lyrics that let you sing along your favorite song. Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant). You can use this voice search to conduct all types of searches on this song finder app.</p>
<p>You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.</p>
<p>Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.</p>
