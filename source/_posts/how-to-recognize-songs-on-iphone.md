Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.

Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.

### · Reduce Background Noise

Your audio performance is instantly improved if you reduce background noise. Any disturbing noise in the background falls under this category. It can be the fan, air conditioning, ticking clocks, etc. You should move away from the noise.

### · Use High-Quality Microphone

For better audio performance, use a high-quality microphone for your Zoom meetings. This factor is the most important factor when it comes to improving audio. Investing in a decent and good external microphone is never a bad option.
