## Essential Tips for Efficiently Gathering Podcast Files Onto Personal Computers

Listening to Podcasts is a great way to gather information. Name a topic, and you will find a Podcast on it. You can always count on the best Podcast shows to get quality knowledge.

You can listen to those Podcasts online. But, sometimes, users want to download the Podcast. The reason can be anything; you might want to listen offline. There are various ways to get the job done. We will walk you through different methods to download Podcasts to the computer.

## Can you download a Podcast as a file?

Yes, it's possible. But the process is a bit different for many platforms.

If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

The backward of using Podcast manager apps is that it can only save your Podcast in the manager app. If you uninstall the app accidentally, you lose access to the saved Podcast because it won't be available on your PC.

To cope with this problem, we provide third-party apps to directly download the Podcast to your computer from the manager apps.

It’s been some time since people have been receiving information in the form of audio files. From college lectures and audible notes to project meetings, interviews, etc. a large amount of information is being shared through audios. But audio files make it hard to access the information whenever you choose as it can be buried in hours of recordings.

So there is a need to convert these audios into texts. Texts are easy to access and it is also possible to selectively choose the information you need whenever you need it.

But you might be worrying about how to convert hours of recordings to texts. Don’t worry, due to the advancement of technology, there are now a lot of applications available to us that can **transcribe audio to text** free.

## How to Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android and iOS

Most people receive or record audio files on their mobile phones. From students to businessmen, the mobile phone is like a central hub that sends, receives, and stores information, including large audio files. So let’s have a look at how to convert audio to text on both android and iOS devices.

### #Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android

To convert audio to text on an android device, one of the best options is to use the [Speechnotes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en&gl=US) application. Speechnotes is a free app that offers unlimited dictation and is suitable for all kinds of people including thinkers, bloggers, joggers, etc.

This application packs in a variety of features like a backup to google drive, nonstop recording, incorporation of google speech recognition for accuracy, offline support, etc. let’s see how to transcribe audio to text using this app:

**Step 1:** Open Playstore and download the Speechnotes application.

### #Convert Audio to Text Free on iOS

If you are using an Apple device and wish to convert audio to text, then the [Dictation](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictation-speech-to-text/id1124772331) speech to text app is the best choice for you. This application will allow you to dictate, translate and transcribe any texts instead of typing them. All most of all texting applications can be configured to operate with dictation which can be a big saver for you during your busy times.

Some of the features of dictation include 40 dictation and translation languages, audio recording, conversion of recorded files, synchronization with iCloud, easy sharing, etc.

Let’s have a look at how to transcribe audio to text using the Dictation app:

![transcribe audio to text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-transcribe-audio-to-text.jpg)

**Step 1:** Open the Dictation application on your Apple store and download it.

**Step 2:** After the installation, open the application.

**Step 3:** Hit the Dictate Button at the bottom to start recording and speak what needs to be recorded.

**Step 4:** After recording hit the same Dictate Button to stop.

**Step 5:** Tap on the Copy tab to copy the text that has been converted or hit on the Send tab to share it via any messaging application.

In this busy world where everything is happening fast, it is very important to keep up. Nowadays, everyone in different instances tends to share information in the form of voice messages. Be it long lectures, product information, briefings, etc. voice recordings are shared very much across the world.

But it is difficult to retrieve information from long audio and hence there is a need to convert audio to text. It is much easier to access information if it's available in text form rather than audio form. It also enables us to selectively access and marks the needed information. Applications like Speechnotes and dictation allow us to record and convert audio to texts. These applications help us to save time for typing as well as in accessing the information later. So if you are having a problem dealing with audio and need to convert audio to text, check out the apps we have suggested above. Thank you.
