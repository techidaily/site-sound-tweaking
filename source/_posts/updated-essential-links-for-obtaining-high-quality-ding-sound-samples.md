## Navigating the Best Online Platforms for Acquiring and Sharing BGM

Starting with good news for music lovers. Like stock images and stock videos, the background music also has a license for downloading. Let’s talk a little about free music before jumping on to different BGM music sites. There are two different types of free music. One where you can use the music without for any purpose. The music is not restricted to copyright; it's known as 'Public Domain.'

The other type is 'Royalty-free Music,' which allows the purchaser to pay for the music license only once. Along with these, another license is 'Creative Common License.' With this type of license, you can easily download and share music tracks for free. Now that you know a little about free music let's move on and discuss popular sites for BGM mp3 download.
