Whether you’re a player or a viewer, you know that video game sound effects are incredibly crucial for immersion into a game.

Many times, watching or playing these games would be boring without that little addition. Streamers use all kinds of video game sound effects in their productions, and if you [make video games](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you’ll use them too.

But, can you find classic video game sound effects that you’re able to use on YouTube with no problem?

Are there options that are royalty-free and won’t get you kicked off of your streaming website?

Here are the 8 best free video game sound effects that are available on the web.

## 8 Excellent Video Game Sound Effects

### 1. [Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://www.sounds-resource.com/gamecube/crashtagteamracing/sound/26205/)

Do you remember the days of zipping around the track as Crash Bandicoot and all of his friends? If so, then this is the sound that will likely come to your mind.

If you’re looking for some old-school Game Cube noises, this is about the most iconic one out there, and you can get it for free.

![Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/crash-tag-team-racing-sound.jpg)

### 2. [Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://www.soundsnap.com/taking%5Foff%5Fback%5Fbattery%5Fcap%5Fin%5Fxbox%5Fone%5Fcontroller%5Fwav)

Wireless controllers changed the world as we know it, and in the past, we needed to change the batteries quite frequently.

So, this noise will take your audience back to the good old days when you had to take the back battery cap off. This little “click” has a lot of nostalgia associated with it!

![Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/taking-off-back-battery-cap.jpg)

### 3. [Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://sounds.com/samples/release/4833/sound/693773)

Space – the final frontier, and the setting of a wide array of video games. Whether you’re a Mega Man aficionado or you are flying the skies with Star Fox, this “bleep” will take you and your audience back in time.

Most commonly associated with ray guns, weaponry on aircraft, or quick teleporting, this unique noise has a lot of uses and is fun to add to any project that you may be putting together.

![Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/bleep.jpg)

### 4. [Platform Game Shot](https://www.audioblocks.com/stock-audio/platform-game-shot-hel8el2nlphk0wxseuy.html)

This sound is similar to the previous “bleep”, but it’s a lot shorter in duration and it has a very specific purpose to it. You could repeat this noise a few times in a row in order to imitate the “pew pew pew” you may hear when someone is shooting in a platform game. Since it’s only a one-second clip, you have a lot of flexibility as to when and how you’re going to be able to use it in your projects.

![Platform Game Shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/platform-game-shot.jpg)

### 5. [Jump Landing Sound](https://opengameart.org/content/jump-landing-sound)

Jumping into oblivion is a favorite pastime of many gamers of all backgrounds, and all of us know that crazy feeling that we get when we’re getting ready to leap, so to speak.

But, if we aren’t sure of what’s on the other side, we breathe a sigh of relief when that simple “thud” indicates that we’ve hit solid ground. This jump landing sound may bring back some of those memories for you.

![Jump Landing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/jump-landing-sound.jpg)

### 6. [Classic Game Sound Jump](https://www.zapsplat.com/music/classic-game-sound-jump-version-5/)

When was the last time that you played a platform-style game? Many of us know of great games like Mario, and we know the most iconic of video game sound effects – the jump. This “boing” noise has been used in many contexts over the years, and it’s not a surprise that we list it as one of the best sound effects that you need to know.

![Classic Game Sound Jump](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/classic-game-sound-jump.jpg)

### 7. [Starfleet Countdown](https://elements.envato.com/starfleet-countdown-with-british-female-voice-UX85D2Z)

Generic countdowns are useful in a lot of situations in video games, but why should you record yourself doing it when there are so many free options available? This particular countdown is performed by a British female’s voice, which makes it sound so much more dire and exciting. It can add a little bit of flair to whatever sort of a countdown that you may be used in your game or during your stream.

### 8. [The Devil Laugh](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/the-devil-laugh/)

If you’re putting together any horror game or a game where there is an evil mastermind, then “The Devil Laugh” is one of the most iconic sounds that you can put into your game.

It can throw anyone off guard while, at the same time, bringing them into the action in a creepy way.

The Devil Laugh is a right, fun way to let people know that something is afoot and that they should pay attention.

Using classic video game sound effects to get people connected with and excited about the content that you’re streaming or producing can be a lot of fun.

Some sounds are just so recognizable, and if you’re playing a game or making your own, you need to include them in whatever you’re doing.

Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

## How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods

You can fix distorted audio using various methods. They include:

### Method 1: How To Fix Distorted Audio in Audacity

Audacity is the bread and butter for individuals who adore a crisp audio quality. Audacity helps users finetune various attributes of their recordings.

Now, use compression to your advantage. If compression confuses you, think of it as a tool that adjusts your audio for the listener's benefit. Compression not only quiets the background minutiae that creeps into your recording, but it also boosts your voice and gives it a full, captivating resonance.

1. To start the compression process, select your audio track, press CTRL + A, click "Effect" and then click "Compressor."

![compress your audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-4.png)

So you're all set: you've sat down, grabbed your microphone, fired up your recording software, and started pouring out the content of your mind. Once finished, you listen back to the recording, thinking you're about to hear the silky-smooth undertones of your voice resonating through your ears, but something odd occurs — it sounds terrible. Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

#### In this article

01 [What Causes Distorted Audio?](#part1)

02 [How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods](#part2)

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

## How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods

You can fix distorted audio using various methods. They include:

### Method 1: How To Fix Distorted Audio in Audacity

Audacity is the bread and butter for individuals who adore a crisp audio quality. Audacity helps users finetune various attributes of their recordings. It is a free and intuitive software suite suitable for newbies and individuals who don't interact with computers. With that in mind, here is how to fix distorted audio using Audacity.

1. Open the audio file by dragging and dropping it into Audacity.
2. Select the distorted part and click on the Effect option. Then, select Noise Reduction.

![fix distorted audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-1.png) ![how to fix distorted audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-2.png)

1. The Noise Reduction window will open.

![noise reduction in audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-3.png)

1. Now, click on Noise Profile, and Audacity will know what to filter out.
2. Next, select the entire audio and open the Noise Reduction Window again ( Effect > Noise Reduction ). Then, set the values to suit your preferences.
3. Hit preview to check the audio, then the Click OK button.

If the audio is still distorted, apply the filter again. Don't overdo the process numerous times to ensure your audio is not degraded, making the voice sound robotic and tinny.

Now, use compression to your advantage. If compression confuses you, think of it as a tool that adjusts your audio for the listener's benefit. Compression not only quiets the background minutiae that creeps into your recording, but it also boosts your voice and gives it a full, captivating resonance.

1. To start the compression process, select your audio track, press CTRL + A, click "Effect" and then click "Compressor."

![compress your audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-4.png)

1. Adjust the values in the compressor to meet your needs and make your voice "pop" from the background.
2. Once you have set the values, hit the Preview button to check the audio. Then, click on OK.

That is how to fix distorted audio using Audacity.
