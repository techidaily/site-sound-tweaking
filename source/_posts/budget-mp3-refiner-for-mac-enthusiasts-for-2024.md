### Option 1: YouTube

You can download a Cat Sound Effect from the YouTube search bar. In order to download the video, you can copy the link and use a YouTube specific video downloading website online.

This website allows users to select the format of the output file. With this, it has never been easier to download videos for either personal views or to convert to audio.

It's easy to convert a video to an audio file. There are online websites that allow users to convert cat sound effect videos into an mp3 file.

Another way to level up the audio file’s quality is by choosing the highest bitrate. Bitrates from audio can be anywhere from 96 bitrates to 320 bitrates.

Convert the file with a higher bitrate for better quality. Then embed the audio for its intended use.

### Option 2: Wondershare Filmora

A slightly more accessible option is to use Wondershare's Filmora, a video editor with powerful and versatile options to create videos like cinematic masterpieces.

The audio library has varied audio assets available for easy embed when editing with Filmora's video editing tool. This can even be done with minimal effort from the user.

Filmora's Royalty-Free sound effects can even be used independently of the software. Just download the sound effects needed, like a cat mp3 sound effect, and use it in your video.

One pro when using Filmora is adding an audio track to a video clip. You can add another audio track at the end and keep overlaying.

This allows audio clips to be used in sync and creates rich aural cues that amp up the entertainment value of your video.

![Detach the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-tool-for-cat-sound-effects-2.png)

Thanks to the timeline feature in the Filmora studio, you can easily add audio at any insertion point. The audio tracks on the Filmora timeline display audio waveforms.

Filmora also allows users to add their audio files. The music library is sorted into categories and allows searching by title.

![Audio settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-tool-for-cat-sound-effects-3.png)

The audio mixer can help users adjust the volume of the file when embedded in a video. You can change the audio waveform on the timeline to modify the audio.

Filmora has options to remove any ambient background noise.

Wondershare Filmora is one of the highest audio and video editing software programs, thanks to its exceptional capabilities and interface.
