 Video reverse is undoubtedly a fantastic way to demonstrate a scene in an interesting way. Filmed normally and then played backwards, this kind of videos can sometimes produce some amazing visual effects. If you want to know some pretty good videos that are played with video reversal, or backwards as some may call it, and learn from their creativeness so as to create one of your own, then you have certainly come to the right place. The following 5 videos top our list of the best backwards music videos.

## 5 of the Best Backwards music videos

### [1\. Forward by Messe Kopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6jprOZ29wY)

 This video was created by Messe Kopp and it is a perfect example of how backwards video techniques have evolved over recent years. It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

## How to Add Audio to AVI

# How to Add Audio to AVI

_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

![remove audio track from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg)

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.
