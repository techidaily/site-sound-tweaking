If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

Step1 Install the Spotify app on your PC or Mac.

Step2 Open the Spotify app and login to your account.

### When you save a Podcast, where does it go?

Saved Podcasts are usually added to the saved list in your Podcast library and will be available for offline listening. But if you want to get access directly on your computer, then you need a third-party tool to download it from the Podcast manager app to your PC, as mentioned above in the article.

### Is listening to a Podcast the same as downloading?

No. Podcast download involves saving a Podcast episode to your Podcast app. But listening to a Podcast refers to the number of times you played a Podcast.

## Final words

You can download the Podcast from a Podcast manager app, an audio recorder, or a video platform. You can also use third-party tools to get directly downloaded Podcasts on your Computer.

Ensure you follow all the steps mentioned above smoothly. Now, enjoy your Podcast with high audio formats wherever you are!
