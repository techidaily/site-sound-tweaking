Its title speaks for itself. There won't be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.

Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It's also available as an app (for iOS).

A poorly recorded audio can ruin a perfectly captured video, but luckily all video editing programs allow you to remove audio files you don't want to use from your project. If you recorded the audio from your Smartphone or a camera that doesn't feature a professional microphone, chances are that the audio in that video clip will not be used in the project you are working on.

We will show you how you can remove audio files from a video in Magix Edit Pro in only a several simple steps that take a minimum amount of effort and time.

## Removing Audio from Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

During the editing process original audio files are often separated from the video files because video editors can manipulate video files better and the audio files are replaced by the sound recordings of better quality.

#### 1. Place the video clips onto the timeline

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-remove-audio-from-video.JPG)

The first step in the process of removing audio from the video will require you to place the video clip onto the timeline. You can do so by clicking on the 'Import' tab and dragging the file to the timeline from the folder in which the video clip is stored. After you've positioned the video file onto the video track in the Magix Movie Edit Pro you will notice that the audio file isn't displayed, which means that audio and video tracks are linked together and that all the changes you make on the video file will also apply to the audio file.

#### 2.Separate the audio and the video

![magix ungroup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG)

In order to avoid changing the speed of the audio file when you are trying to alter the playback speed of the video file, you need to separate the two files. You can do this easily, by selecting the video clip on the timeline and clicking the 'Ungroup' icon located on the editor's toolbar. Upon clicking the 'Ungroup' icon you will be able to see the audio file on the track directly below the video track.

If you would like to remove an entire file, select it and then right-click on it. From the menu that emerges select the 'Delete objects' option or just hit the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to use parts of the original file utilize the 'Split objects' tool to separate the parts of the audio file you want to use, from the ones you don't need. Then after cutting all the parts of the file, you don't want to use, delete them by using one of the two methods we described.

In order to reach a high level of precision, click on the 'Zoom current object' icon that is located in the lower right corner of the editor. Choosing to zoom in on the audio file you are working on will enable you to have a better control over it and apply all the changes and audio effects with a higher level of precision.

#### 3.Export the project as an audio file

After you made all the changes you wanted and removed all the parts of audio files you didn't want to feature in your video you can export only an audio file.

Select the audio files you want to export on the editor's audio track and click on 'File/Movie export'. From the 'Movie export' menu, select one of following options 'Audio as MP3' or 'Audio as WAV', depending on the output format you wish to use. Adjust the export settings and wait for Magix Movie Edit Pro to complete the export.
