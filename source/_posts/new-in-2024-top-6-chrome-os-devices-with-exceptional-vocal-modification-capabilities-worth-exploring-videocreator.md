For instance, if you tell a story through a YouTube video, you can use the piano background in multiple segments and scenes. Here are some ideas to make YouTube videos interesting using piano background music:

### · In the Opening Scene

The piano background will sound splendid in the opening scene. You should choose an engaging music piece in the introduction. If the music perfectly blends with the video, your audience will watch the complete YouTube video

### · For Intense Scenes

Cinematic music is important to create interest and excite the audience. With the help of music, you can leave your viewers in surprise. For instance, if you want to reveal the criminal, you can use cinematic music to enhance the thrill.

### · For Emotional Scenes

Royalty-free background music in the emotional scenes helps the audience to connect with your characters. Have you ever wondered how animators add emotions to cartoons? They use emotional music in the background and engage the audience throughout the scene.
