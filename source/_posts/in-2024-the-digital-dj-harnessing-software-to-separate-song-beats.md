Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.
