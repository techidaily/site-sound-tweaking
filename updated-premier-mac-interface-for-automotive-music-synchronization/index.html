One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add music recognition feature to control center"
                ></p>
<p>It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.</p>

                      alt="using  music recognition feature in iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.</p>
<p>You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.</p>
<p>The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.</p>
