I hope you now have a clear grasp of installing and uninstalling Audacity on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa. I hope this article has been helpful. Additionally, we cover Filmora's voice effects & how users may use the program to improve and change their own voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. The Pitch option on the Timeline may be used with video/audio and voiceover files. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound unique. You may quickly alter the voices in the videos with Filmora. A story or video should accompany your viral. Allows you to alter the pitch of your voice by selecting the Changing Pitch option. You may adjust the video's pace (Optional). Make a duplicate of the video or audio that has been altered.
