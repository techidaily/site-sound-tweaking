 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |

## Ten Best AI Music Composers You Should Know About

![ AI Music Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Amper-Music.jpg)

Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled ‘Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game. Besides enabling its users to create music from scratch, AIVA can also be used to produce variations of existing songs. The music engine that powers this AI music composer makes the production of corporate or social media videos much easier, as it eliminates the need to go through the music licensing process.

Each track that is available through this AI music composer can be edited, so you can change its length or its tempo. You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.

The AI music composer comes bundled with a rich collection of chord progressions, that contains almost all chords used in popular music.
