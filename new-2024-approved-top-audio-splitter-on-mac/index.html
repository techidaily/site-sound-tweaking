<p>There are times when you need to split audio files with the use of your Mac. The fastest and best way to do the task is with the use of an audio splitter for Mac. There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Recommended-Best-Audio-Splitting-Tool-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Recommended-Best-Audio-Splitting-Tool-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 1. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Although widely known as the best video editing software for beginners, Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also serves as a great audio editing tool. It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.</p>
<p>One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button.

It is open-source software that has the ability to split MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio files. It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.</p>
<p>The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.</p>

<p>There are times when you need to split audio files with the use of your Mac. The fastest and best way to do the task is with the use of an audio splitter for Mac. There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.</p>

It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.</p>
<p>One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button.

It is open-source software that has the ability to split MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio files. It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.</p>
<p>The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.</p>

You can also choose the start and end time to split.</p>
<p>Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware has a playback feature that allows you to play the audio file and adjust its volume. The audio splitter Mac software is compatible with Mac OSX 10.4.x or 10.5.x with at least 512 MB of physical RAM. The only downside is that it can only split audio files that are unprotected or DRM-free.</p>

<p>There are times when you need to split audio files with the use of your Mac. The fastest and best way to do the task is with the use of an audio splitter for Mac. There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Recommended-Best-Audio-Splitting-Tool-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-1-Recommended-Best-Audio-Splitting-Tool-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 1. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Although widely known as the best video editing software for beginners, Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also serves as a great audio editing tool. It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.</p>
<p>One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button. Download a free trial version to try it right now:</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App-2"><a href="#How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose a Music Recognition App?"></a>How to Choose a Music Recognition App?</h2><p>Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices.

</ul>
<p>Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket.

Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
