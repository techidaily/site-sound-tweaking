### Step 4: Split Audio

Now comes the fun part. Once the audio file is on the timeline, you will see a play head. You need to drag the play head to the point where you want to split the audio. You will see a scissor option after dragging the play head; hit that to split audio into two parts.

### Step 5: Edit the Separated Audio

You can delete the audio that you don't want by selecting it and pressing the 'Delete' button on the keyboard. In comparison, you can edit the other part of the audio. For this, double click on the audio in the timeline to open Audio Editing Window.

### Split Audio after Detaching from Video

As we have mentioned, sometimes you like a sound, but it is part of a video. Do you know a way to get that audio from a video? Well, yes, with Filmora, you can get your favorite audio even from videos and then split it.

This could be done by using its ‘Detach Audio from Video’ feature. What this feature does is that it separates the audio from video and displays both the files separately on the timeline. You can delete the video file by selecting it and pressing 'Delete.' Whereas, by following the above-mentioned steps, you can then split the audio easily with the Filmora MP3 splitter.
