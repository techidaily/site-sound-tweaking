No doubt, the **Audacity denoise** feature is available for use, but it is difficult to access. Someone with primary editing skills cannot operate this software. Hence, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for denoising audio and elevating content. You can employ two of its features to remove background noises. With its [Audio Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) feature, you can decrease various types of noise.

It can assist in audio enhancement and denoising wind noise, echoes, and hums. With its [AI Vocal Remover](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) feature, you can separate vocals from background noise. Both these features use AI technology to improve audio accuracy. Hence, it is your perfect replacement for **Audacity background noise**.
