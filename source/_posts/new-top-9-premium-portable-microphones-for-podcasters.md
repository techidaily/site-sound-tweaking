If you are just starting your podcast or would like to take it to another level, then you need to have the right microphone. After all, the audio quality is the most important thing in your podcast and should not be taken lightly. Thankfully, with the help of a reliable **podcast microphone**, you can certainly improve the quality of your audio. Since there are so many options out there, I have handpicked the 9 best podcast microphones at entry, intermediate, and pro levels.

* [Part 1:What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?](#part1)
* [Part 2:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Entry level](#part3)
* [Part 3:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Intermediate Level](#part4)
* [Part 4:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Professional Level](#part5)

## What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?

To select the best podcast microphone to meet your requirements, I would recommend keeping the following things in mind.

**Consider the microphone type**

Microphones can be classified based on their placement or working. For instance, you need to decide if you want to get a podcast microphone with a stand or a handheld one. Similarly, an omnidirectional microphone would function differently than a cardioid one.

**What and where are you recording?**

Getting a microphone to record speech would be different than the one to record music. Also, consider your setup and check whether the microphone would work with your other devices. Getting a podcast with polar sensitivity is better in almost every environment.

**Check the specifications**

Furthermore, make sure that you check specifications like impedance, connectivity, working frequency, ease of use, etc. before you purchasing a microphone.

**Budget and user reviews**

Lastly, make sure that you stick to a budget while filtering podcast microphones and check the review of its existing users to make up your mind.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.

![podcast directory spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-3.jpg)

It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.

![podcast directory apple podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-4.jpg)

The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.

![podcast directory google podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-5.jpg)

![podcast directory pandora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-6.jpg)

Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.

"Pandora Podcasts recommendations are a blessing for me, who always finds it confusing to locate the right episode to spend my time on."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 64 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 6\. [Audible](https://www.audible.com/ep/podcasts?source%5Fcode=BLGORWS0107160001)

Although popular among audiobook lovers, Audible has a considerable podcast following too. Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.

Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there's a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

Last but not least podcast directory on our list is Stitcher. The platform boasts more than 14.5 Million active listeners, with an average listener having up to 25 hours of listening duration per month.

Stitcher helps you alleviate the stress of getting your show to the right audience, and thanks to the platform's easy podcast submission requirements, you only need to have at least one podcast episode on your RSS Feed to get approved.

Also, Stitcher offers a unique analytic tool that allows you to track the performance of your show on the platform, and what more impressive is that it's integrated into more than fifty car models. In addition, it works with any vehicle that supports Apple's CarPlay and Android Auto, which makes it a great choice for podcasters who believe their audience loves to listen to their show while driving.

* **User Review of Stitcher**

"So glad I switched! I have my podcasts but didn't listen to them much - partially because Apple Podcasts is so hard to use. I switched to Stitcher to listen to The Magnus Archives, and I love it!"

* **Monthly User Base:** Over 1.5 million active users.
* **Supported OS:** Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.
