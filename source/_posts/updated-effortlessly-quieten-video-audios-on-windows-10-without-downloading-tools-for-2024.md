Last but not least, Filmora has other features called TTS and STT. Speech to Text (STT) allows you to transcript voice to subtitles in one click. Using speech-to-text will save you a lot of time on subtitling and speed up the editing process. Meanwhile, Text to Speech (TTS) is a feature in Filmora that lets you turn text files into voiceover and add more elements to your video.

How to use STT with Filmora

Step1 Firstly, right-click on the audio track and choose "Speech-to-Text".
