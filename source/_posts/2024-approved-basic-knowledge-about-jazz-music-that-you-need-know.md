Since 2016, when AIVA Technologies was founded, its team has worked on developing an AI script that can compose emotional soundtracks for ads, video games, or movies. Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled ‘Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game. Besides enabling its users to create music from scratch, AIVA can also be used to produce variations of existing songs. The music engine that powers this AI music composer makes the production of corporate or social media videos much easier, as it eliminates the need to go through the music licensing process.

**Price:** Free version available, Pricing plans start from $0.99 per download

![AI Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Jukedeck.jpg)

The AI music composer developed by the Jukedeck startup resembles the Amper’s music composer because they both rely on neural networks to analyze music data, that is then used by the AI to learn how to compose original music. Each track that is available through this AI music composer can be edited, so you can change its length or its tempo. You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.

Note: Jukedeck has been acquired by TikTok, and we are waiting for a new Jukedeck.

However, you can’t use Brain.fm to create your own music, as this platform is better suited for people who spend a lot of time at work and have a tough time maintaining their focus while performing important tasks.

**Conclusion**

The opportunities AI music composers offer are still not properly explored, because most of these technologies are still under development. The results AI music composers we included in this article have managed to achieve so far are impressive because each of them can produce high-quality audio files for all sorts of video content. Which AI music composer do you like to use the most? Leave a comment, and let us know.
