When you rip music from a CD or an app, you're copying songs from a source to your PC.

The era of CDs and cassettes is long gone today; we talk about music apps and how to extract mp3 sounds from them.

#### In this article

## Part 1\. What Is Spotify Ripper?

We all know Spotify is a fantastic app to listen to music, but it only works online. So, if you wish to listen to songs while you aren't connected to the internet, you have one option. You can rip audios using a full feature Spotify music ripper to get unlimited playback on all devices. Save the audio files in MP3, FLAC and other formats. Let's see how you can go about ripping songs from Spotify.

## Part 2\. How to Rip Spotify Music on Windows and Mac?

If you like some playlists or songs on Spotify, you might want to listen, download and save them on a computer. But to do this, you have to subscribe to the app. However, premium users can play and download songs on the app itself. They can't listen to them on other music players. So, you may ask if there is a way to rip and save Mp3 songs from Spotify to the computer for free?

Yes! If you find the right Spotify ripper, you can enjoy music anywhere offline without any limitations. Let's have a look at these five powerful rippers that allows you to rip from Spotify.
