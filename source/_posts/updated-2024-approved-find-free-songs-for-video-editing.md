 Many of you might be interested to know about the concept of audio editing and method to implement this task for real time applications. Actually the audio editing task is something same as that of making changes in any written document. Things from audio file can be copied, pasted, replaced, cut and deleted as per need and simple manipulation functions can be applied to do something interesting as a result. It can be applied to so many applications for example if we have to remove any undesired interference like cough, breaths, phone sounds from audio files or want to loop, slice or adjust various beats.
