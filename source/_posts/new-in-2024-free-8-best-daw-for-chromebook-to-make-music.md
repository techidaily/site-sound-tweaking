## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

02 [5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor

Have you ever looked at the internet and the number of options you get whenever you search for MP3 tag editor Mac free? The page is all packed and loaded with tons of different options. No doubt it's tough to select a good tag editor, but what if we tell you some tricks for selecting a great Mac music tag editor? Without any further delay, let’s begin.

### · Easy to User Interface

A primary factor that is considered while selecting any tool, the editor, is its interface. If any software offers a complex interface, users don't prefer it. An easy interface means all the editing, manipulating, adding, deleting options appear on the front. Users don't have to struggle to find basic options.

### · Online Database Search

If any macOS MP3 tag editor offers an online database search means it’s a good editor. This is because not all editors support online search. The option is very helpful as the online search shares all the information related to any searched tag.

### · Editing Options

How many editing options do you prefer? Editing metadata means that you should be able to edit and manipulate as many fields as possible. For instance, the Mac music tag editor should allow changing the singer's name, year tag, and all the other fields.

### · Batch Processing

Editing is a stressful and hectic job. Is there a way to help yourself? Let’s share about Batch Processing. If the Mac MP3 tag editor allows batch processing, then it's a great choice. This is because editing individually can take hours, but batch processing reduces the editing time as well as the editing efforts.

### · Supported Formats

How many formats can your Mac music tag editor support? Although all the tools are MP3 tag editors, not all audio files have MP3 format. For this reason, always select the tag editor that can support and edit different files formats.

## Part 2\. 5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor
