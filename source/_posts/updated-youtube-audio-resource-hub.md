## Part 3 Is YouTube Sound Library Free?

A simple answer to this question is: Yes, YouTube Sound Library is free. The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

But just like every Google and YouTube tool available on the internet, YouTube Sound Library also comes with a bunch of terms and conditions. As a content creator and user of the audio from the library, you will be required to keep those terms and conditions in mind before using the music. If you somehow breach the guidelines mapped out by YouTube, you run the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

## Part 5 How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?

Now that you have downloaded your desired music for your video, the question arises, how to integrate it into your video?

A straightforward answer to that can be, using YouTube Studio’s built-in video editor. But considering the limited features it has on offer, you might require something that can allow you to add premium features: drag and drop special effects, custom animation on the go, and much more.

So, if you are looking for such features too, then [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the answer to your requirements.

These background noises can be a huge distraction for your viewers and might even annoy them off. Therefore, Filmora has come up with the best de-noise feature to help you reduce the background noises in your video.

● Fade Audio in or out: Like the transition of the scenes in a video, the audio change is equally important. You cannot complete a perfect transition without a proper audio fade. Filmora offers you a more straightforward method to adjust the audio in your video during the transition.

● Beat Detection: Syncing a video has been a hassle for content creators over the years. Beat detection has, however, changed the game completely. In Filmora’s beat detection feature, you can analyze the music and generate beat markers to help you while syncing the audio and special effects.

I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. As you can see, both the Mac and iOS iMovie app lets us mute audio on any video. Though, if you are looking for more features and want to edit the sound in your videos, then you can give Wondershare Filmora a try. The application has a dedicated audio mixer and even lets us add voiceovers to videos. There are several other audio and video editing features in Wondershare Filmora that you would love to explore!
