### Youtube Audio Library

You may find YouTube’s Audio Library under the "Create" feature. It includes a diverse range of musical styles. You are free to utilize any music in your video project.

The soundtrack is a combination of public domain, and Creative Commons licensed pieces. All you would need to do is credit the track's creator.
