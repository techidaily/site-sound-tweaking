There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

### 1\. [Google App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US)

On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.

Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

And don't worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.

### 2\. [Shazam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android)

Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds. You will get to find and listen to your desired song and get all related information like lyrics, videos, and artist's profile.

You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.

Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 5\. [Genius – Song Lyrics & More](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US)

Genius is more of a lyrics finder app than a song identifier app for Android. Its database contains lyrics of more than 1.7 million songs, and that database is entirely crowdsourced. Besides lyrics, you will get authentic information regarding the backstory of the songs on the database.

It can also translate lyrics in real-time, thus enabling you to learn a new language while doing one of your favorite tasks listening to music.

You can stream MusiXmatch on television via Chromecast, and the app is available on all Android wearable devices. A premium version of this app allows you to view lyrics offline, removes advertisements from the app, and enables a party mode where themes play in sync with the song lyrics.

**Conclusion**

The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.

Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).

To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

And don't worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.

## Part 2: Make an Anime Voice in Adobe Premiere

Adobe Premiere is a software application for video content creators and editors. In the case of TV series or dramas, even professional actors often need a bit of pitch adjustment to voices. Pitch shifting is not only made easy but accessible to all as well in Premiere Pro. Below all the key steps are highlighted, which provide you with the precise process of making anime voice in PR.

![ Anime voice changer  premiere  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-anime-voice-with-premiere-pro.jpg)

Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.

Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the "Pitch Shifter" effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose "pitch shifter," and then drag down to the audio file.

Next, it’s time to adjust the pitch as per the need. We can shift the pitch higher for a sharp female voice or down for heavier vocals. If you now have achieved the desired results, you know how to use this anime girl voice changer.

Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio. This effect is usually a popular trend with anime voice changers. To give nasal effects, you have to load the EQ first. Next, you need to cut or boost the frequencies as per your need. The limit provided is usually 1k to 1.2k Hz.

These are the main effects one gets to choose from when using Adobe Premiere.

In track 1, tap the "R" button which will turn your microphone for voice recording. Next, tap the "I" button to hear the effects you apply while editing.

Choose your desired effect from the library tab and test it while you adjust other settings.

And that’s it! It is that easy to make settings in Adobe Audition.
