<p>When compared with other video editors out there, Premiere Pro by Adobe is used for all kinds of large scale products including Hollywood movies and TV shows. This is due to the reason that Adobe Premiere offers every possible feature that you can ever want in a video editor. Even though Adobe Premiere Pro is not free to use, it is still a great option for many users who want to edit videos more than just adding music files. Whether it is advanced video effects, plugins support, automated editing, extensive media support, color grading options, VFX support, compatibility with other Adobe tools, sound design, or anything else, Adobe Premiere Pro offers it all. As a result, if you want to use Premiere Pro for adding music to video files, then it can be done quite easily as described here:</p>
<p>● Even though the user interface of Adobe Premiere Pro can be a little intimidating, adding music in it is still quite easy.</p>
<p>● To start, go to the Media Browser in Adobe Premiere Pro to find and browse your desired music tracks.</p>
<p>● You can then right click on a music track and select Import to get the music track in the media library.</p>
<p>● Finally, you can open the Media Library and drag this music track onto your timeline where it can be moved under any video of your choice.</p>
<p>● If you want, you can select the music track and go to the Effects Control window to change the volume levels, pitch, keyframes, and apply all other kinds of music effects before saving your video with music under it.</p>

<p>In case you just want to add music to video files without using or applying any more effects, then you don’t need to install any programs on your computer. Instead, you can use one of the various online video editors for putting music over videos. Such video editors are completely free and do not use your computer’s processor which makes them great for entry level computers which cannot run heavy video editing programs. Most of these online video editors are also quite easy to use with basic and simple user interfaces making them great for beginners. You can also put music over videos online using such video editors by going through this step by step guide:</p>
<p>● First, open the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.onlineconverter.com/add-audio-to-video" >Audio to Video Tool by Online Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in any web browser of your choice.</p>
<p>● Now, choose the video file and the audio file that you want to combine together into a single media file.</p>
<p>● You can also change settings like the position of the audio, its volume level, mute the video file, and many others.</p>
<p>● Once all settings are changed to your preferences, you can click on Add to save the video with music added to it.</p>

<p>While all the various video editor apps given above are great for easily adding music to videos, all of them require you to have a computer for using them. Unfortunately, not everyone has a computer which means that using the methods stated earlier might not be feasible. Thankfully, you can still put music on video files using your smartphone. This is made possible thanks to various video editors available for mobile devices out there. One such great video editor option that you can use on your mobile device is Kinemaster. Not only can it be used for adding music, but you can also use multiple video effects, add video layers, add text and images, use an inbuilt media library, and so much more. And if you just want to add music to videos, then you can use Kinemaster as given in these steps:</p>
<p>● Since Kinemasater is made for mobile devices, its user interface is quite simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>● You can simply click on the Audio button to import any music file that you want to add to your video.</p>
<p>● Finally, adjust the music track to any position of your choice by long pressing on it and save the video with music added to it.</p>
