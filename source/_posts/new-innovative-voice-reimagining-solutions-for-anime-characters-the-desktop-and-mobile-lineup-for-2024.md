Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free.
