The scream sound effect, also widely known as the Wilhelm scream sound effect is a stock sound effect of a scream, commonly used in scenarios including a fall, a gunshot, an explosion or similar activities. This is a hugely popular screaming sound effect that has been vividly used across films, TV shows and even cartoons. The first recorded use of this sound effect dates back to 1951, in a film called Distant Dreams.

However, this sound effect got its name from Private Wilhelm, a character in the movie ‘The Charge at Feather River’, on whom this sound effect was used when he got shot by an arrow.
