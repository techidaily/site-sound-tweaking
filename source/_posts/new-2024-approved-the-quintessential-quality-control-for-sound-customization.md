Open Filmora video editor on your Windows or Mac computer, and import your audio file to the audio track in the timeline. Go to the **Titles** tab, and select your preferred title. There are plentiful title templates in Filmora video editor for different scenarios, such as gaming, social media, education & tutorial, travel, and sports. If you just want to add plain text, you can go to the Basic category or Plain Text category to add simple text without any animation.

**Step 2: Type text to build the Lyrics you want**

![customize lyric texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg)

 Double click the title in the timeline and then click the **Advanced** button to go to the Advanced Text Edit window. From there, you can write your lyrics, add a text box, change colors and font, and add animations to the lyrics.

**Step 3: Add Transitions to Lyric Text**

![add transitions to lyric texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg)

Go to the **Transitions** tab and select the desired transition. For example, you can search warp on the search bar, and it will list many wrap effects. You can choose one wrap transition effect first and then double click the transition to set its duration and position.

**Step 4: Add Effects to a lyric video**

To make the lyric video more vivid, we can add some special effects to the lyric frames.
