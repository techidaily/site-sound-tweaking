## Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Making an Audiobook?

The benefits of getting your book published in the format of an audiobook are numerous.

Nowadays, audiobooks actually make more sense with a large number of audiobook listeners worldwide.

Here are some potential advantages of audiobooks and why you should learn how to create an audiobook:

#### 1.More profit

According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.

Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.

#### 2.Larger audience

Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.

#### 3.No worries about stock

#### 4.Easy discovery

Your book will become easily discoverable when you publish it in the version of an audiobook also. Printed books are comparatively least discoverable online unless they have an audiobook version. The more discoverable your book is, the more is its reach to the targeted audience.

#### 5.Save on time and expenses

The creation of audiobooks is comparatively easy and low in cost. You can either hire services like ACX and Audiobook Creation Exchange. Or else, you can nowadays also create audiobooks on your own by using online programs such as Filmii.

## Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?

We have seen the advantages of transferring your book into audiobook format in the last section. Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.

1. You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.
2. Record the audiobook yourself.

At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.

Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.

* **Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.
* **Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.
* **Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.
* **Step Four:** Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.

And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.

You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.

 Click on the **Open** button in the Add Videos and Photos window and your clip will be imported into the software.

**Step 2:** After you added a clip to the storyboard you can preview it in order to decide which parts of the video you'd like to mute. Click on the **Edit** menu in the software's ribbon, to gain access to the video editing tools Windows Movie Maker has to offer.

 If you would like to mute only a portion of a video clip, you should position the playhead on the storyline at the exact location in the video where you want to make the cut and then click on the **Split** button.

**Step 3:** Make sure that the clip you want to mute is selected and click on the **Video Volume icon** on the left side of the Edit tab.

 A drop-down menu will appear offering you to select music from an online source or to import an audio file from your computer. Moreover, you can select the starting point of the song you're importing so you don't have to adjust the position of the audio file in your project manually.

You can change the position of the audio file by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard.
