### Step 3: Edit the Audio

The audio and video will appear separately on the timeline, in two different tracks. Do you think the video is of any use? Certainly not. Right-click on the video and select the option of ‘Delete.' After this, you can freely edit the audio file if you want to. Double click on it to open the ‘Audio’ editing panel.

### Step 4: Export and Save the File

Lastly, export the file when you are satisfied with all the edits. For that, hit the ‘Export’ button. In the ‘Local’ tab, you need to select ‘MP3’ as the output format. This is because we are exporting a sound file. In the end, save the file to your desired location and tap on 'Export' from the bottom right corner.
