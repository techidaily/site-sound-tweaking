Why would we want to remove audio from video?

There are many reasons why someone would prefer to remove the audio from a video file. Some of the videos captured will have a lot of noise in the background and that can be an annoying experience while watching the video. Some prefer to add different audio or a music file to their videos to make it more appealing and attractive to people. So whether it is to watch a silent video or a video with a different audio file, the original audio will have to be removed.
