## Section 3\. How to choose Music Editor for Mac users?

Choosing a music editor for Mac, including the ability to edit and output to MP3 and MP4 formats, depends entirely on your needs. If your needs are modest and limited features or functionality work for you, several free-to-use options will get the job done. If you need more robust functionality and professional quality, a pay program will offer more satisfying performance. Keep in mind the following questions when making your choice:

* How often do I need to edit music and audio?
* Do I need simple trim and edit features, or also audio effects?
* What formats are my source files, and what formats do I want to output to?
* What is my budget, and how can I balance performance and price?

With Filmora, you can edit music and audio files with ease. Besides basic cutting features, you can apply fade-in and fade-out effects, adjust the audio volume. What's more, you can remove the background noise in the audio to get a clear sound.
