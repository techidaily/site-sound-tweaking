#### How to make your Voice Higher while Recording

There are so many ways and exercises that can help change the pitch of your voice and make it higher even if you don't have high pitch voice. We are going to discuss 5 exercises that can help you achieve this task. But remember that these exercises will practice and patience in order to show the required results.

1. **Focus on Breathing**

The higher voice you want the more air it will need. To higher your voice, you have to take deep breathes from your nose and release them while speaking. It will boost the pitch of your voice and make it higher than your usual voice. Singers use this technique while they want to hit a high pitch. It gives your body and lungs the power to generate a higher voice. Breathing plays a very vital role in making your voice higher. If you are not breathing correctly, you can't keep the voice higher for a longer period of time. Just like all other skills, this exercise also needs a lot of practice to master. Start practicing this technique by reading a sentence, then move forward to a paragraph, and so on. Following this process will make you master the process of highering your voice using your own breaths. Then you can start using this technique in all of your videos very easily.

1. **Listen to Your Voice**

Do you find it amusing to know that you haven't ever heard your own voice if you haven't listened to your own recorded audio or video? You will find your voice very different on the recording than in reality. Because in reality, it is difficult to focus on listening to your own voice while you speak. You will probably hate your own voice the first time you listen to it as a recording. To make your voice higher, it is important to listen and observe your voice very carefully and analyze where it goes down and where it goes up. It will help you improve your voice after every try. This practice will help you master the process of highering your voice using your own analyzes.

1. **Remove the Obstacles**

Since now we know that the main way to make your voice higher is to provide your lungs power with the help of your own breathes. But what makes it decrease its intensity is the obstacles that come in the way of your voice. The first and main obstacle that your voice faces is your tongue. Everyone knows the importance of tongue in helping you speak and generate words. But it sometimes works as a hindrance to block the sounds our lungs make. Therefore, it is very important to keep your tongue in the right position while generating high pitched voice. Try to keep your tongue as low as possible and don't let it touch the upper part of your mouth to avoid creating a blockage for your voice. In the beginning, it will feel like an impossible task, but as you move forward and practice it more often, you will notice the difference. This will enhance your voice a lot and take it to a level, where you had never imagined it would reach. If you are failing again and again, then don't worry. This is not an easy task to accomplish, it requires patience and consistency to master.

1. **Use Nasal Voice**

There are multiple ways of generating voice in a human body. Just like the mouth, sometimes the nose is also used to release voices. Those who use Nasal voices while they speak have a higher voice than those who don't. The gateway used by the nose to release voice is very narrow, producing a thinner voice resulting in high pitched sound. It is also not a good practice to use this technique very often. Because it can make you irritated and annoying. Try to mix the nasal voice only 50% to the voice of your mouth to keep it safe, and sound normal.

1. **Focus on your Posture**

If you know anything about signing or you know any singer, you will come to know that your posture plays a very vital role in generating the sound of your choice. The ideal posture for a higher voice and proper tone is to sit with your back straight, keep your tongue as low as possible, rest your mouth and look slightly upward to make your neck relax a bit. This can completely transform your voice and make it sound like a professional.

#### How to make your Voice Higher while Recording

There are so many ways and exercises that can help change the pitch of your voice and make it higher even if you don't have high pitch voice. We are going to discuss 5 exercises that can help you achieve this task. But remember that these exercises will practice and patience in order to show the required results.

1. **Focus on Breathing**

The higher voice you want the more air it will need. To higher your voice, you have to take deep breathes from your nose and release them while speaking. It will boost the pitch of your voice and make it higher than your usual voice. Singers use this technique while they want to hit a high pitch. It gives your body and lungs the power to generate a higher voice. Breathing plays a very vital role in making your voice higher. If you are not breathing correctly, you can't keep the voice higher for a longer period of time. Just like all other skills, this exercise also needs a lot of practice to master. Start practicing this technique by reading a sentence, then move forward to a paragraph, and so on. Following this process will make you master the process of highering your voice using your own breaths. Then you can start using this technique in all of your videos very easily.

1. **Listen to Your Voice**

Do you find it amusing to know that you haven't ever heard your own voice if you haven't listened to your own recorded audio or video? You will find your voice very different on the recording than in reality. Because in reality, it is difficult to focus on listening to your own voice while you speak. You will probably hate your own voice the first time you listen to it as a recording. To make your voice higher, it is important to listen and observe your voice very carefully and analyze where it goes down and where it goes up. It will help you improve your voice after every try. This practice will help you master the process of highering your voice using your own analyzes.

1. **Remove the Obstacles**

Since now we know that the main way to make your voice higher is to provide your lungs power with the help of your own breathes. But what makes it decrease its intensity is the obstacles that come in the way of your voice. The first and main obstacle that your voice faces is your tongue. Everyone knows the importance of tongue in helping you speak and generate words. But it sometimes works as a hindrance to block the sounds our lungs make. Therefore, it is very important to keep your tongue in the right position while generating high pitched voice. Try to keep your tongue as low as possible and don't let it touch the upper part of your mouth to avoid creating a blockage for your voice. In the beginning, it will feel like an impossible task, but as you move forward and practice it more often, you will notice the difference. This will enhance your voice a lot and take it to a level, where you had never imagined it would reach. If you are failing again and again, then don't worry. This is not an easy task to accomplish, it requires patience and consistency to master.

1. **Use Nasal Voice**

There are multiple ways of generating voice in a human body. Just like the mouth, sometimes the nose is also used to release voices. Those who use Nasal voices while they speak have a higher voice than those who don't. The gateway used by the nose to release voice is very narrow, producing a thinner voice resulting in high pitched sound. It is also not a good practice to use this technique very often. Because it can make you irritated and annoying. Try to mix the nasal voice only 50% to the voice of your mouth to keep it safe, and sound normal.

1. **Focus on your Posture**

If you know anything about signing or you know any singer, you will come to know that your posture plays a very vital role in generating the sound of your choice. The ideal posture for a higher voice and proper tone is to sit with your back straight, keep your tongue as low as possible, rest your mouth and look slightly upward to make your neck relax a bit. This can completely transform your voice and make it sound like a professional.

Why Do You Need An Audio Mixer For Streaming?

If you've ever wondered why some people's audio sounds so much better than others when streaming, it's likely because they're using an audio mixer.

An audio mixer is a console that takes multiple audio signals and combines them into one signal. This allows you to control the individual levels of each sound, as well as add special effects like EQ and reverb.

While you don't necessarily need an audio mixer to stream, it can certainly make your life easier. So, if you're planning on doing any sort of professional streaming, this device is a must-have. However, they can be expensive, complicated to use, and sometimes add latency to your live audio.
