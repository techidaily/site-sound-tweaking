<p>The step-by-step guide to add music to video using iMovie –</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone launch the iMovie app and click ‘Project’ from the top of the screen, and tap ‘Create Project’ represented by a ‘+’ icon.</p>

                      alt="imovie project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click ‘Create’ and then ‘Movie’ to open the project interface on screen. Browse the ‘Media’ option from the top left corner of the timeline and explore the video gallery on screen and pick the desired video for editing then hit ‘Add’ and then ‘Use’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-media.JPG"
                      alt="imovie media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The source video gets added to the timeline. You need to reach to the starting point of the video, so that you can add audio from there. Add audio by following similar process to that of adding video from the gallery, but tap ‘Audio’ after clicking the ‘Add Media’ button. Ensure that music has been placed at background, by tapping the ‘Background’ button from the bottom of the screen. By clicking the ‘Theme Music’ option you can find the synced media on your device.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click ‘Play’ for previewing the audio visual, and click ‘Done’ if satisfied with your new creation.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> iMovie will loop the background audio automatically, in case the video runs longer than the audio. It is recommended to adjust their lengths while merging them.</p>

Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.</p>
<h4 id="Use-filters-and-effects"><a href="#Use-filters-and-effects" class="headerlink" title="Use filters and effects"></a>Use filters and effects</h4><p>You can apply filters&#x2F;effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video&#x2F;audio.</p>
<h4 id="Volume-is-important"><a href="#Volume-is-important" class="headerlink" title="Volume is important"></a>Volume is important</h4><p>Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.</p>
<h4 id="Change-tempo"><a href="#Change-tempo" class="headerlink" title="Change tempo"></a>Change tempo</h4><p>The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.</p>
<h4 id="Use-fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#Use-fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="Use fade in and fade out"></a>Use fade in and fade out</h4><p>While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.</p>

How to add audio to video on iPhone&#x2F;iPad</h4><h4 id="iMovie-1"><a href="#iMovie-1" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a>iMovie</h4><p>If you want to add music to video in your iPhone, then the in-built iMovie option helps you import music from Theme, iTunes and your own music. Your videos will be turned into exhilarating master pieces.</p>

<p>The step-by-step guide to add music to video using iMovie –</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone launch the iMovie app and click ‘Project’ from the top of the screen, and tap ‘Create Project’ represented by a ‘+’ icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="imovie project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click ‘Create’ and then ‘Movie’ to open the project interface on screen. Browse the ‘Media’ option from the top left corner of the timeline and explore the video gallery on screen and pick the desired video for editing then hit ‘Add’ and then ‘Use’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="imovie media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The source video gets added to the timeline. You need to reach to the starting point of the video, so that you can add audio from there. Add audio by following similar process to that of adding video from the gallery, but tap ‘Audio’ after clicking the ‘Add Media’ button. Ensure that music has been placed at background, by tapping the ‘Background’ button from the bottom of the screen. By clicking the ‘Theme Music’ option you can find the synced media on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click ‘Play’ for previewing the audio visual, and click ‘Done’ if satisfied with your new creation.</p>

When there is no music with the software, you might import music from an external source to add audio to your video.</p>
<p>The biggest problem while using the audio tracks is copyright issues, they are not always copyright free. But, there is nothing to worry about. There are sites that offer free of cost stock music&#x2F;audio tracks across genres that you can use and make a breath-taking audio visual.

Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.</p>
<h4 id="Use-filters-and-effects-1"><a href="#Use-filters-and-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Use filters and effects"></a>Use filters and effects</h4><p>You can apply filters&#x2F;effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video&#x2F;audio.</p>
<h4 id="Volume-is-important-1"><a href="#Volume-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="Volume is important"></a>Volume is important</h4><p>Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.</p>
<h4 id="Change-tempo-1"><a href="#Change-tempo-1" class="headerlink" title="Change tempo"></a>Change tempo</h4><p>The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.</p>
<h4 id="Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-1"><a href="#Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-1" class="headerlink" title="Use fade in and fade out"></a>Use fade in and fade out</h4><p>While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-1"><a href="#Final-Verdict-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.</p>

Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.</p>
<h4 id="Use-filters-and-effects-2"><a href="#Use-filters-and-effects-2" class="headerlink" title="Use filters and effects"></a>Use filters and effects</h4><p>You can apply filters&#x2F;effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video&#x2F;audio.</p>
<h4 id="Volume-is-important-2"><a href="#Volume-is-important-2" class="headerlink" title="Volume is important"></a>Volume is important</h4><p>Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.</p>
<h4 id="Change-tempo-2"><a href="#Change-tempo-2" class="headerlink" title="Change tempo"></a>Change tempo</h4><p>The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.</p>
<h4 id="Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-2"><a href="#Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-2" class="headerlink" title="Use fade in and fade out"></a>Use fade in and fade out</h4><p>While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-2"><a href="#Final-Verdict-2" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them.

How to add audio to video on iPhone&#x2F;iPad</h4><h4 id="iMovie-3"><a href="#iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a>iMovie</h4><p>If you want to add music to video in your iPhone, then the in-built iMovie option helps you import music from Theme, iTunes and your own music. Your videos will be turned into exhilarating master pieces.</p>
<p>You can effortlessly browse through the music files and create awesome 4K-resolution movie and Hollywood-style trailers to amaze your friends. iMovie is built to work in sync with your iOS and Mac devices.</p>

<p>The step-by-step guide to add music to video using iMovie –</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone launch the iMovie app and click ‘Project’ from the top of the screen, and tap ‘Create Project’ represented by a ‘+’ icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="imovie project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click ‘Create’ and then ‘Movie’ to open the project interface on screen. Browse the ‘Media’ option from the top left corner of the timeline and explore the video gallery on screen and pick the desired video for editing then hit ‘Add’ and then ‘Use’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="imovie media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The source video gets added to the timeline. You need to reach to the starting point of the video, so that you can add audio from there. Add audio by following similar process to that of adding video from the gallery, but tap ‘Audio’ after clicking the ‘Add Media’ button. Ensure that music has been placed at background, by tapping the ‘Background’ button from the bottom of the screen. By clicking the ‘Theme Music’ option you can find the synced media on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click ‘Play’ for previewing the audio visual, and click ‘Done’ if satisfied with your new creation.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> iMovie will loop the background audio automatically, in case the video runs longer than the audio. It is recommended to adjust their lengths while merging them.</p>

Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.</p>
<h4 id="Use-filters-and-effects-3"><a href="#Use-filters-and-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Use filters and effects"></a>Use filters and effects</h4><p>You can apply filters&#x2F;effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video&#x2F;audio.</p>
<h4 id="Volume-is-important-3"><a href="#Volume-is-important-3" class="headerlink" title="Volume is important"></a>Volume is important</h4><p>Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.</p>
<h4 id="Change-tempo-3"><a href="#Change-tempo-3" class="headerlink" title="Change tempo"></a>Change tempo</h4><p>The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.</p>
<h4 id="Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-3"><a href="#Use-fade-in-and-fade-out-3" class="headerlink" title="Use fade in and fade out"></a>Use fade in and fade out</h4><p>While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.</p>

What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?"></a>Part 1. What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?</h2><p>Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice. The environment has a significant effect on the way someone walks, talks, or even how someone acts on something. There are various factors upon which your voice sounds unique and special; some of these factors are briefly discussed below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-Gender"><a href="#1-Gender" class="headerlink" title="1. Gender"></a>1. Gender</h3><p>Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.</p>
<h3 id="2-Structure-of-Anomalies"><a href="#2-Structure-of-Anomalies" class="headerlink" title="2. Structure of Anomalies"></a>2. Structure of Anomalies</h3><p>The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person’s voice. The structure of one’s voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.</p>
<h3 id="3-Body-Structure"><a href="#3-Body-Structure" class="headerlink" title="3. Body Structure"></a>3. Body Structure</h3><p>Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.</p>
<h3 id="4-Height"><a href="#4-Height" class="headerlink" title="4. Height"></a>4. Height</h3><p>Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.</p>
<h3 id="5-Heredity"><a href="#5-Heredity" class="headerlink" title="5. Heredity"></a>5. Heredity</h3><p>Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?"></a>Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?</h2><p>There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.</p>
<p>The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="Change-the-Way-you-Talk"><a href="#Change-the-Way-you-Talk" class="headerlink" title="Change the Way you Talk"></a>Change the Way you Talk</h3><p>Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.</p>
<h3 id="Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords"><a href="#Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords" class="headerlink" title="Taking Care of Vocal Cords"></a>Taking Care of Vocal Cords</h3><p>Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Exercises"><a href="#Vocal-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Exercises"></a>Vocal Exercises</h3><p>There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.</p>
