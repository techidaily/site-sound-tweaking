### 2Add photos to audio and rearrange them

 Then select these added files and move them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The photos should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the music track. Then put the photos in the order you want them to appear in your creation. After that, adjust timing by highlighting and target file and moving the red slider.

 Besides that, you can also improve the quality of your photos and even apply special effects to them. To review the list of available filters and effects, click the “Effects” button in the tool bar to display the menu. Here is a detailed guide about how to apply effects to video.
