There are various podcast editing services, and styles worth consider. The list below is the critical podcast editing basics a beginner should follow before publishing the podcast. Overall, it would be awesome if you learn new skills instead of outsourcing the whole stuff. That’s fantastic as well!</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, import the audio.</strong></p>
<p>The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.</p>
<p><strong>Listen again</strong></p>
<p>Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.</p>
<p><strong>Make it consistent throughout</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Designing and Mixing</strong></p>
<p>Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.</p>
<p><strong>Preview and Post</strong></p>
<p>Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio&#x2F;video. Finally, post your podcast, either for free or using one of the software available online on your desired blog&#x2F;online media.</p>
<h2 id="Which-DAW-should-you-use"><a href="#Which-DAW-should-you-use" class="headerlink" title="Which DAW should you use?"></a>Which DAW should you use?</h2><p>You can’t miss using Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for podcast editing at any cost. It is an audio editing program with all the facilities right from recording the podcast to editing it. To start with, you must consider using among the following three DAWs.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Podcast Daw Audacity"
                ></p>
<p>Audacity is the most common program providing free podcast editing services. The foremost reason for its popularity is the free and open-source availability. Secondly, the primary user interface makes it the best option for beginners. You can right away start recording with Audacity.</p>
<p><strong>Alitu</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/podcast-daw-alitu.jpg"
                      alt="Podcast Daw Alitu"
                ></p>
<p>Alitu is another recommended tool to make your podcast episodes easily. However, you have to pay to get the podcast editing services of Alitu. It can incredibly do the podcast editing for raw audios and provide you with different options of adding music, transitions, and segments, etc. It also contains the facility to publish your podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Reaper</strong></p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Reaper is another best podcast editing DAW with the availability of 60 days free trial. Despite a bit high learning curve in Reaper, you will ultimately feel like an artist working upon it. Moreover, it comes with lots of new updates and features for better outcomes. It is compatible with AU, VST, and JS plugins as well.</p>
<h2 id="Advanced-Editing-Tips-to-Spice-Up-Your-Podcasts"><a href="#Advanced-Editing-Tips-to-Spice-Up-Your-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts"></a>Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts</h2><p>Don’t miss out on this portion if you want to upgrade your podcasting skills like professionals! Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Ends</strong></p>
<p>It’s better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.</p>
<p><strong>Work on your planning and presentation skills</strong></p>
<p>Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Provide margin and look for transitions</strong></p>
<p>Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn’t provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.</p>
<p>Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate awkward silences</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust the volume of the podcast</strong></p>
<p>It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.</p>
<p><strong>Save podcast to the right format</strong></p>
<p>Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-Podcast-with-Video-Editor"><a href="#Edit-Podcast-with-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Edit Podcast with Video Editor"></a>Edit Podcast with Video Editor</h2><p>Are you recording a video podcast?

<p>Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Provide margin and look for transitions</strong></p>
<p>Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn’t provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.</p>
<p>Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate awkward silences</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust the volume of the podcast</strong></p>
<p>It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.</p>
<p><strong>Save podcast to the right format</strong></p>
<p>Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.</p>

<p><strong>Listen again</strong></p>
<p>Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.</p>

The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.</p>
<p><strong>Preview and Post</strong></p>
<p>Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio&#x2F;video.

What are podcast directories?</h2><p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

<p>According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:</p>

                ></p>
<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube"><a href="#1-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory youtube"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create video-based podcasts seamlessly.

<p>Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).</p>

<li><strong>User Review of YouTube on G2</strong>: “YouTube is one of those sites that you can’t live without for a business. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and users (globally) use the platform daily.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 2.5 billion active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All major OS and web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Spotify"><a href="#2-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="podcast directory spotify"
                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Spotify on G2</strong>: “I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 360 million active users.</li>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#3-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="podcast directory apple podcast"
                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 28.5 million active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All Apple devices.</li>
</ul>

Google Podcasts"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasts.google.com/" >Google Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Google Podcasts has over 100 million downloads on Play Store alone and is also available on the web, App Store, Blackberry, and ChromeOS users. A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It’s simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more.”</p>

Pandora"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pandora.com/" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours&#x2F;monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Pandora Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Pandora Podcasts recommendations are a blessing for me, who always finds it confusing to locate the right episode to spend my time on.”</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>It is important to note that both Amazon Music and Audible offer podcasts for entirely free to users, so a more extensive user base prefers these platforms over paid platforms.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

<li><strong>User Review of RadioPublic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.</p>
<p>The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I’m delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels “complete” to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand.”</p>

<p>**”**Nice alternative to Apple’s. I’ve been well pleased so far. It isn’t always the most intuitive, but I’ve eventually figured out how to achieve almost everything I’ve wanted to. The benefits of adding a show via RSS have become immediately clear.</p>

</ul>
<p>“Wonderful app, the most reliable one I’ve found. Even with accounts, most others lose all your progress data which hasn’t happened once with this, and I’ve switched phones 3 times. The progress tracker is so accurate you can pause on one device, open the same account and continue listening. Most apps can’t even keep things downloaded. Search does take a minute but finds stuff no other app does.”</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube-1"><a href="#1-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>

<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>

It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

<p>The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I’m delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels “complete” to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand.”</p>
