Vocals are often overlooked in contemporary electronic music, but there are so many ways they can be used creatively. The platform lets you turn up to 50000 characters into speech at once, and it also offers several different voices you can choose from. Before you create an audio file you can determine how fast the text is going to be vocalized, so you should try different options and see which one fits your project the best. Text to Speech platform can be used during the process of creating a new song, but the tools it offers are not enough to make an entire song.

This is a perfect tool for developing an idea for a song, as you can create a sequence in just a few minutes. You can choose from Piano, Drums and Guitar categories of instruments or browse through a huge collection of fully customizable preset sequences that is updated on a daily basis. The platform also lets you import MIDI files and work on projects youâ€™ve already started developing or you can export your sequences as MIDI files from the Online Sequencer and edit them with your DAW. Even though Online Sequencer is a useful tool for making music, the features it offers canâ€™t really be compared with those on Soundation or AudioSauna.

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
