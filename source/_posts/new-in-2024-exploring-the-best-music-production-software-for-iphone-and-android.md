Party, Travel or Fashion are among the types of scenes you can choose from, while moods range from happy to serious. When done, simply click on the Create Music button, and the platform will automatically generate the soundtrack for your video.

![ AI Music Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Melodrive.jpg)

At the moment, the Lite and Indie versions of Melodrive are available for download free of charge, but the Indie version of this AI music composer still offers more options. Melodrive is one of the first AI systems that can compose emotional and unique music in real time. The AI generates music by adapting to the media environment and aims to match the mood and the style of the video. It is worth noting that Melodrive is still under development and that through time its capabilities to compose music are going to become even more refined than they already are.

You can’t generate music automatically with ORB Composer, because the AI creates music based on your choices. That’s why you need to know at least the basic rules of music composition in order to be able to use the ORB Composer properly. The AI music composer comes bundled with a rich collection of chord progressions, that contains almost all chords used in popular music. This tool is aimed at artists who are interested in experimenting with the possibilities of creating music with artificial intelligence and discovering new styles of music. There are six music templates you can choose from, and you can create compositions by simply organizing different blocks of music.

Humptap also has video making capabilities, so you can create videos for all songs you compose with this app. All tracks and videos generated with the Humtap AI music composer can be saved to your phone, but you can’t share your new creations to social media directly from the app.

A team of scientists, musicians and engineers uses artificial intelligence to generate music designed to make your brain more productive and focused. They claim that the music created with their AI music composer achieve its effects in just ten to fifteen minutes. However, you can’t use Brain.fm to create your own music, as this platform is better suited for people who spend a lot of time at work and have a tough time maintaining their focus while performing important tasks.

**Conclusion**

The opportunities AI music composers offer are still not properly explored, because most of these technologies are still under development. The results AI music composers we included in this article have managed to achieve so far are impressive because each of them can produce high-quality audio files for all sorts of video content. Which AI music composer do you like to use the most? Leave a comment, and let us know.
