## Cutting Through the Clutter: Innovative AI Strategies for Signal Purification

## How to DeNoise AI

There have often been times when we took some photo or video with our mobile phones or digital cameras, but we found out later that the clip contained hiss, some compression or particles. Everyone, especially in this digital world, is trying to make their content as clean as possible, without impurities, for the audiences to watch, enjoy, and stay with the creators. So, you might find it really uncomfortable when you are in this kind of situation. But what you can do, is doable – you can depend on a video denoise software!

There are a lot of online or offline tools you could use to do that, and we have discussed a lot of them on our web-site, and now, we will review yet another way to achieve your desired result when it comes to noise and grain. So, in today’s article, we will touch upon how to AI DeNoise your image!

The case with this intelligent noise reduction for 2022 is that noise reduction software has been the same for over a decade. This is when DeNoise AI comes to play, because its approach is something new – it uses deep learning. The process is lengthy and focuses on learning millions of images, thus let DeNoise AI to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. This is so important because with this new technique, now it is possible to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that was impossible a few years ago.

Topaz DeNoise AI has a very simple and intuitive interface with different noise removal options. Anyway, using it in the most effective way would require some knowledge. Oh, and, it would be a headache if you have a slow computer!..

So, as mentioned, traditional noise reduction software most of the time reduces the original detail in the images, but DeNoise AI’s noise reduction eliminates noise, meanwhile, preserves the detail and even enhances it. The new update of Topaz DeNoise AI offers different advanced DeNoise AI Models that can be integrated perfectly into your workflow; you can use it as a standalone piece of software or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.

## How to AI DeNoise a file

Let’s just suppose you don’t have the software. So, download and install Topaz DeNoise AI. Go to Topaz Labs and select your operating system: Windows or Macintosh OS. Then, install the program.

![download and install topaz denoise ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-1.jpg)

Once the installation is finished, you will be able to see the Topaz DeNoise AI icon among your applications. Topaz DeNoise AI plugins for Lightroom or Photoshop would also be added there automatically, without any further intervention. But, if that is not the case, it’s ok to add them manually.

The first time you open Topaz DeNoise AI, you can either log in with your Topaz Labs account or try the Denoise AI 30-day free trial.

So, let’s discover how to use DeNoise AI in its different versions!

**First, how to remove digital noise with DeNoise AI:** DeNoise AI supports most of the commonly used photography files like raw files, dng, tiff, jpegs, etc. So, open the program, drag or open your image and select the best AI model.

In the upper right corner, you will find a toolbar with these options:

**Preview Options:**

To change the view mode of the photo you’re working with, you can select:

* Original (original photo preview)
* Single (denoised photo preview).
* Split (Original and denoised photo preview with a split slider)
* Side by Side ( Original and denoised photo preview)
* Comparison ( Compare how the different Ai Models work in your photos at the same time).

**Zoom**

Zoom in on your images to accurately check the process’s progress.

![zoom in on images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-2.jpg)

Denoise AI full review and tutorial

On the right side, you’ll find:

* A navigator with the selected zoom box.
* A list with the following DeNoise AI Models:
* Standard: Broadly developed noise reduction that maintains detail.
* Clear: Best for photos with smooth and rounded surfaces such as skin, rocks, water, etc.
* Low light: Best for low-light conditions and heavy noise
* Severe noise: Best for extremely noisy photos
* Raw: The newest AI model in DeNoise. It provides excellent noise reduction, preserving detail, and authentic color starting from a RAW file.
* Main Settings. The Auto mode works great in most situations. However, it can be pretty aggressive and give your photos a washed-out look. With Manual Mode, you can set the adjustments according to your taste.
* The Post-processing sliders help reduce any color noise remaining in your photos and preserve original detail.
* Save Image: To set your output settings before saving your images.

![set output settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-3.jpg)

Then, adjust the setting sliders (you can just select Auto mode here); now, apply the adjustments locally, if necessary, using the mask tool; and, save the file with the output settings selected.

**Second, let’ts move to DeNoise AI workflow.**

If you are trying to find the simplest way to start with DeNoise Ai, it’s better to use the suggested mode, - Light bulb icon! This will automatically select an AI model, and will do so based oon your image. Anyway, in order to remove digital noise there, it’s the best to use the updated comparison view. The reason is obvious – you can take a look right away and compare varied AI models, or the same ones with some different settings to your liking.

![use light bulb icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-4.jpg)

So, how to do just that? Well, select the AI model and fine-tune the adjustment using the following settings:

* Remove Noise: This slider is wonderful!. It removes the noise in your photo, but doesn’t kind of wash out the images. Values between 10-50 are the best in most cases.
* Enhance Sharpness: It sharpens and recovers the detail in images that may become a bit blurry after denoising. It would be excessive if you set the values over 30, in case you would like to avoid odd textures.

After that, you can refine your results with these DeNoise AI Post-processing adjustments:

* Recover Original Detail: It helps recover some detail that has been washed out after the noise reduction and adds a bit of grain to keep the image natural. 20-40 points is more than enough.
* Color Noise Reduction: This is a powerful tool that reduces any color noise remaining in your images. Zoom in on a dark area and adjust the slider until the color noise disappears and you are happy with the result!

**And, the last topic to discuss is DeNoise AI Masking Tool!** The software includes a very simple Mask tool in case you want to denoise the image only in certain areas and not in others. So, the key here is that DeNoise AI will apply your adjustments only to the areas that you paint in red.

You need to ckeck the Overlay tool to see the red color while painting. When you are satisfied with the areas you panted, After painting over these areas, you will see a preview of your mask in black and white. Here, white shows the adjustments while black hides them. Following this, DeNoise AI will just be applied to the areas painted in white.

![check overlay tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-5.jpg)

And, the masking settings are:

* Add/Subtract: to paint in white or black and reveal or hide your adjustments.
* Size: to change the size of your brush.
* Softness: to change the hardness of your brush. Being 0 is the hardest and 100 the softest.
* Opacity: to vary the opacity of the mask to add precise local adjustments.
* Mask options: to clear or invert your mask.
* Overlay: to show in red these areas where you are painting.

Once you finish creating your mask, just click on the “apply mask” button, and there you go!

With this, you will see the Smart Denoise, where you are able to change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![see smart denoise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-7.jpg)

You can now reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

Of course, it is much easier than DeNoise AI looks and works, and it’s worth the try – will take so much less minutes!

## Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise

We already explained how video image and video denoising work, but, denoising not only means digital noise on the screen, of course. It can be literally a noise! The sound which is not so pleasant to listen to… Audio background denoising is to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![drag and drop video into timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-8.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

![double click on audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-9.jpg)

Keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![click on customize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-10.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![lower sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-11.jpg)

So, in this article, you learned about different noises, and about different tools and programs to denoise your images, videos, and audios! Pretty enlightening, ha? Let’s hope this is something you are looking for, and will put to good use very, very soon!

## How To Record Your Computer Audio in Audacity

In modern times, it has become a common practice to record your audio files. This is usually beneficial for many purposes. Be it for business meetings, podcasts, or just an informative lecture you have taken down. You will always need to record computer audio from time to time in the year 2022.

![how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster1.jpg)

Over the past decade or so, computer users have recorded their audio and converted it into a digital format with relative ease. However, users look to record computer audio at even the highest quality levels. And while the technology needed to achieve this is readily available in both software and hardware forms, it can be somewhat complex.

If you want to record any sound or audio on your computer, this article is meant for you. Whether you are looking to do a voice-over on a video or just want to record some random audio notes, you can easily make it happen. This article will guide you to record your computer audio using a PC easily. We will share different methods using which you can record computer audio.

This article is not directed at potential audio recorders but rather at those looking to improve the audio quality of their recordings. Users will already have their microphone and recording equipment, yet they may find this article useful.

## **Recording Voice On Windows**

If you are using a pc or desktop, then keep in mind that most operating systems have their own default recording software that comes pre-installed. Most people don't know about them, and they rush for 3rd party applications for sound recording purposes. It doesn't matter if you use Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11\. Windows operating system also has its recorder app. It will be available on your system, and all you need to do is find it and use it. If you are unsure how to do that, then follow the steps given below.

1. Go to the search options of your windows and type "Voice Recorder" in it.
2. Click on the search button, and the voice recorder app will appear in the top searches.

![how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster2.png)

1. Just open the app, and a recording button will appear on the screen. All you need to do is, click on the recording icon, and it will start recording your audio from your microphone, and when you are done recording, you click on the stop recording button, and it will automatically be saved on your computer.

![how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-record-your-computer-audio-poster3.png)

## **Recording Voice On Mac**

If you are using Mac operating system, then it also has its recording app. Just follow the steps given below:

Recordings can be created using the built-in microphone, an external microphone, or a headset with a supported microphone. If you're signed in with the same Apple ID on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac, you can listen to your Voice Memos recordings on any of those devices.

1. Click on the Record button (or use the Touch Bar) inside the Voice Memos app on your Mac.
2. By clicking the Pause button, you can pause the video. You can resume the video by clicking Resume.
3. At the bottom of the page, click Done when you are finished.

## **Record Voice Using Audacity**

Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.

1. First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching "audacity windows 7", "audacity windows 8", "audacity windows 10", or "audacity mac" depending upon the operating system you are using.
2. Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.
3. Now you'll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be 'Windows WASAPI'. From the next choice to the right, choose 'Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)'.
4. It's important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers
5. Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time
6. Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.

## **Final Verdict**

That's how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows/Mac 10's built-in 'Voice Recorder' app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.
