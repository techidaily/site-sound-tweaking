"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 28.5 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: All Apple devices.

However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.

![podcast directory google podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-5.jpg)

![podcast directory pandora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-6.jpg)

Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.

However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast's team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.

Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there's a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.

![podcast directory audible](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-7.jpg)

* **User Review of NPR One Podcast**

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

* **Monthly User Base**: 500 thousand
* **Supported OS**: Android, iOS

### 8\. [Tune In](https://tunein.com/)

The podcast directory has a global user base of over 75 million and a monthly visit of 7million+, which makes it a great spot for any podcaster to publish their show.

* **User Review of Tune In Podcast**

"I've been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying "features."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 7 million active users
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 9\. [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/)

* **User Review of PodcastAddit**

**"**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening/ referencing/ re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 750 thousand active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated Android App and web presence.

The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I'm delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels "complete" to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand."

Being a subscriber to a show and getting early access episodes and bonus material right in my podcast manager makes it easy to stay up with all my shows."

The progress tracker is so accurate you can pause on one device, open the same account and continue listening. Most apps can't even keep things downloaded. Search does take a minute but finds stuff no other app does."
