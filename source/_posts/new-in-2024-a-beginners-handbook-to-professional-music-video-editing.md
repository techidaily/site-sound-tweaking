### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.
