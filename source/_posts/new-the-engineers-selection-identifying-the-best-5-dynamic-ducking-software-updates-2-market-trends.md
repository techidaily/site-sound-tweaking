## What is Audio Ducking?

Do you wish to go live with beautiful background music, interactive sessions, or a fun party time? Many of you would have heard of this [audio ducking mechanism](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as video creators and audio spectators. But, let me introduce it for better understanding.

Audio ducking is a mechanism where the background audio is ducked anytime or compressed temporally if any dual audio is detected or present. Especially in a live session like an emcee, this method helps lower the music when the person starts speaking and rises again when the person finishes. Beyond live sessions, ducking is in narrations, translations, and podcasts as well.

In technical terms, ducking is a sidechain compression where the secondary audio channel takes control over or compresses another channel. If the control channel threshold exceeds, the audio channel lowers, leaving no trace of background audio, and when the point drops, the background audio levels up again. Such chains or compression is a manual job using signal compressors, portable PAs, and Ui24R.
