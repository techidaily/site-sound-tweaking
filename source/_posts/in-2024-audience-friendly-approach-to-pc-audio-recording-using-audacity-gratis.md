A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

Let's look at some of the features available on KineMaster.

![trim/split video on kinemaster app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-add-music-to-kinemaster-9.png)

The first is to trim to the 'left of playhead' (cuts before), trim to 'right of playhead' (cuts after), 'split at playhead' (splits the video into two). The final option is to 'split and insert freeze frame.' These options give you a lot of control over the video.

### Video Transitions

You have many transitions ranging from 3D transitions to transitions for text or picture in picture options. Once you've selected the transition, tap on the tick mark at the top right corner to apply the effect.

### Handwriting

### Animations

One of the better aspects of the KineMaster app is that you can animate individual elements in your video. Each animation has its layer. There are three types of animation.
