Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-1"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-1"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-2"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-2" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-2"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-2" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-2"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-2" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-2"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-2" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-2"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-2" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>

In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-3"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-3" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-3"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-3" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-3"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>

                      alt="vol subtab"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-2"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vol subtab"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>

                ></p>

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg"
                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg"
                      alt="vol subtab"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

                      alt="tns button"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>
