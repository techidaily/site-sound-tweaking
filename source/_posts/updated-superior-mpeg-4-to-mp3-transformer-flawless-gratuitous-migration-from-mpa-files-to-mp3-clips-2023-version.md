![ Anime voice changer  premiere  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-anime-voice-with-premiere-pro.jpg)

Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.

Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the "Pitch Shifter" effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose "pitch shifter," and then drag down to the audio file.
