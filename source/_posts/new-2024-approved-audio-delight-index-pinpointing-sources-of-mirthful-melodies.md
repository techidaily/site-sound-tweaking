## Being the Smarter Person – Using a Song Identifier Online

Yes, it can be exasperating when you want to listen to a song but cannot find it online because you don't know the proper title or who sang that song. All you know is how the tune goes or some other indefinite details of the song.

You might have heard a song in an old recording and liked it, but you do not know any detail of it other than what you heard.

These are times when song identifiers online will help ensure you don’t have to worry about not hearing the music you like again. Just hum the song or upload an audio file of it to the websites and every detail of it becomes available to you at the expense of a few clicks.
