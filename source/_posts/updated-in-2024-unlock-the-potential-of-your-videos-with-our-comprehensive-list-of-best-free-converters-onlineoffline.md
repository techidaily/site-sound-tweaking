Depending on the frequency of your usage and the size of the media files that you generally process, the **video to audio converter** that you choose may vary. While most online solutions are free but offer limited flexibilities in terms of editing and output preferences, the offline apps need to be installed on your computer and would require local hardware resources to function properly.

Most of us have playlists made up of songs that have been either chart-toppers or have gone viral or are immensely popular. But now and then, we come across some obscure and underrated song that suits our music taste. The song might be in a different language or from a foreign country.

We want to find those songs to put on our playlist, but we do not have enough information about them. What do you do? Just use a song identifier online service to look up the song name so that you can listen to your new favorite music again – whenever you want!

There are many song identifier online apps or music recognition online websites that will help you identify those songs. Let us know about them and learn how to use them.

## Song Identifier Online You Should Try In 2024

![AudioTag song identifier  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audiotag-online-music-identifier.jpg)

AudioTag is an easy-to-use song identifier online service. You upload an audio fragment, the duration of which can be as short as 10 seconds or as long as the entire song, and then let the website's audio recognition engine do its job. After it analyses your uploaded audio file, every available information regarding that audio file, like the title of the song, artist's name, album title, etc., are extracted and put at your disposal.

The audio file you upload can be in any format, ADPCM, .WAV, .FLV, .MP3,.MP4, or other commonly used audio file formats. It can be a digitized recording from an old tape recording or a downloaded file from the internet. AudioTag can identify audio in video files too.

* Can work with a wide range of audio file formats
* It has got a robust database that contains songs from the 1940s to present times

## Being the Smarter Person – Using a Song Identifier Online

Yes, it can be exasperating when you want to listen to a song but cannot find it online because you don't know the proper title or who sang that song. All you know is how the tune goes or some other indefinite details of the song.

You might have heard a song in an old recording and liked it, but you do not know any detail of it other than what you heard.

These are times when song identifiers online will help ensure you don’t have to worry about not hearing the music you like again. Just hum the song or upload an audio file of it to the websites and every detail of it becomes available to you at the expense of a few clicks.
