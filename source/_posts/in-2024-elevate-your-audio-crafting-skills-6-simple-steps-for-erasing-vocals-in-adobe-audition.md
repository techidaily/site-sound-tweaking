### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove. It's easy to see that your vocals have been reduced when you preview it.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)
