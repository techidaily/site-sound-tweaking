 A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?

 Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the **New** submenu in the **File menu**.

 Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.

 Click on the **Wrench icon** and choose the **Show Audio Waveform** option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.

 When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the **M keyboard shortcut**, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.

 Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add **In and Out points**, by either clicking on their icons or using the **I and O buttons**, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.

 Choose the **Automate to Sequence** option from the **Clip menu** and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the **Selection Order** option from the **Ordering menu**. Afterward, you should select the **At Unnumbered Markers** setting from the **Placement menu** and change the **Method to the Overwrite Edit.**

 Make sure that the **Use In/Out Range** option is enabled and click on the **Ignore Audio** checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.

## How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?

 Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process. In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s [BeatEdit extension](https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro) for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.

**How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?**

 In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the **Extensions submenu** that is located in the Window menu.

 After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the **Load Music** button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.

 You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the **Create Markers** button.

 Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.

**Conclusion**

 Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators. Hopefully, our tutorial has helped you learn this simple but effective video editing technique so that you can use it to make the videos your friends and followers on social media are going to enjoy watching.

## **Part 1\. How to Remove Drums From Any Song: 2 Easy Methods**

You may have wondered whether there is a way to isolate and remove a drum track easily. Luckily, there are several drum extract free download tools that you can use to take the drums out of any song with just a few clicks. Tools like [Media.io](https://www.media.io/).

Let’s have a look at the techniques that you can use:

### **1\. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App**

Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:

* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

![moises.ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?

* **Cloud-based AI application** – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL
* **User-friendly UI** – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels
* **Keep Track of Progress** – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand
* **Download Separate Files** – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC
* **Free Version is Available** – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money

Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.

### **2\. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins**

For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.

![vst plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG)

With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:

* AudioSourceRe
* UNMIX Drums
* XTrax Stem 2
* Drum Extract

VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.

## **Part 1\. How to Remove Drums From Any Song: 2 Easy Methods**

You’ve probably been there. Wanted to make a drum cover video of our favorite song, but did not know if a drumless version exists. You may have wondered whether there is a way to isolate and remove a drum track easily. Luckily, there are several drum extract free download tools that you can use to take the drums out of any song with just a few clicks. Tools like [Media.io](https://www.media.io/). [UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/), [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), and [LALAL.ai](https://www.lalal.ai/) are known to effectively remove drums from audio files. Let’s have a look at the techniques that you can use:

### **1\. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App**

Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:

* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

![moises.ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?

* **Cloud-based AI application** – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL
* **User-friendly UI** – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels
* **Keep Track of Progress** – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand
* **Download Separate Files** – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC
* **Free Version is Available** – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money

Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.

### **2\. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins**

For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.

![vst plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG)

With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:

* AudioSourceRe
* UNMIX Drums
* XTrax Stem 2
* Drum Extract

VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.

## **Part 2\.** [**Remove and Edit Drums in Audio with Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
