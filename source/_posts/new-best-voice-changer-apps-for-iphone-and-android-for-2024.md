**User Rating:** 4.0

In case you would like to sound like your favorite movie star of TV host, then Celebrity Voice Changer is one of the best choices you can make. Besides the standard set of options, the app also lets you request new voices since its machine learning technology can mimic virtually anyone's voice.
