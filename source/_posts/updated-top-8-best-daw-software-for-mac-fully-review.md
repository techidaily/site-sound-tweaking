## In Pursuit of Quality Sound Capture on a Budget - Ultimate Guide to Free Voice Recorders for the Year 2024

Have you ever forgotten a class lecture or business meeting? If you have, then you are at the right place. This article includes the top 10 voice recorder apps for PC that you can install on your laptop and record everything you want to remember. These are free-to-use tools but do they offer appropriate features to record and edit audios? Let’s dive deep and find how these 10 free voice recorder apps for PC helps users record different sounds, music, and even lectures. So let’s get started:

## 10 Best Free Audio Recording Software for PC

Here are the top 10 free to use voice recorders that you must have on your computer:

### 1\. Free Sound Recorder

Whether you want to create videos, record podcasts, or make music videos, a free sound recorder can be the best tool to record and edit the voice and sounds. The free audio recorder has a simple interface for beginners. Also, professionals can use this tool and mix their audio for clear sounds. This is a high-quality and efficient software for voice recording. To get started with Free Sound Recorder, simply:

* Download the software
* Connect microphone
* Choose sound card
* Adjust recording settings
* Start recording

Although Free Sound Recorder is a free to download software, it offers users with professional-grade production quality that most popular paid tools don’t provide.

### 2\. GarageBand

GarageBand is an exclusive voice recording tool for macOS and provides a complete range of professional tools, music lessons, and virtual instruments. Furthermore, you can connect a premium quality microphone and record voice, vocals, and instruments. Like Free Sound Recorder, GarageBand is an easy-to-use and intuitive tool that offers a wide range of drum tracks, synths, virtual amps, and effects. This free voice recorder tool isn’t compatible with devices other than iOS. Also, you can integrate third-party plug-ins with GarageBand to transpose and edit your music, voice, and other sounds.
