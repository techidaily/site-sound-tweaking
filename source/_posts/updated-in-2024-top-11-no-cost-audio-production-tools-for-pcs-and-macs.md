**Step 1:** First of all, go to Incompetech and open up any page on the site. You'll see that there are links on the left side.

**Step 2:** Click on one of those links, and you'll see a list of songs of that category. Once again, click on one of the songs to open up another page where you can listen to it.

**Step 3:** Once you're done listening, scroll down, and you'll see a link that says "Download this song". Click on the link, and it will start downloading automatically.

**Step 4:** Once downloaded, go into your project and put in the music track where you want the song to go in. If you want a song to be longer, re-download the song and find that "Download this song" link again. Put it where you want the new end of the music to be.

**Step 2:** The next step is to go to a website called SaveFrom.net. When the page has loaded, look for the big blue button that says "Download Video". A new tab or window will open with the download page. It would be best to paste the video URL in the "Enter a video URL" bar.

**Step 3:** After pasting it, click on "Download this video" (the blue button). When it appears, press on one of them. I usually go for mp3 format because it keeps good quality and it's the most used format that you can play on many devices.
