## Song Selection Spectrum: Discovering the Perfect Soundtrack for Every Montage Visionary Project

What's a montage video, you ask? It's the short video you need to save the day. Whether it's in a sports game, a video game, or just your life, montage songs find their way into every aspect of our media. It can showcase your struggle and success as it makes you feel awesome. A montage video is a very powerful way to tell a story, reveal your brand's personality, and demonstrate the power of your product.

Video montage songs are meant to be fun and entertaining. They're like a soundtrack to your montage while bringing out the best parts of the scene. Music can improve a video montage by providing emotional context, elevating the atmosphere, and encouraging viewer engagement. There are many montage videos, such as supercuts, sports edits, comedy clips, and more. All these montages have their tone, style, and subject matter. For this reason, you need to select music that fits in with the rest of your video.

There are many songs out there suitable for montages, but not all of them will make a suitable choice. If you want your video to appeal to everyone and bring people more joy, then you might want to consider these Top 10 Best Montage Songs for Your Montage Video!

## How A Well-Picked Song Enhances Your Montage Video

If you have ever been to YouTube and searched for montage videos, then you must have noticed that they all have one thing in common. They have a great soundtrack.

The music is what makes the montage video so special. The right song can make your montage video go viral, while the wrong one can make it fail miserably.

Here are some tips to help you pick the right music for your next montage:

#### 1\. Choose music that matches the mood of your video

Many people make the mistake of choosing songs that don't fit their videos at all. For example, if you're making a movie about love and romance, it doesn't make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.

#### 2\. Pick songs that match the genre of your video

If you're making a romantic comedy movie, then try picking up some romantic pop songs instead of heavy metal ones or classical ones. This way, your viewers will know right away what type of movie they're watching and will be able to enjoy themselves more because they know what to expect from it visually and audibly.

#### 3\. The length of your montage video

If you have a long montage video (over 1 minute), you may want to use shorter songs (under 3 minutes) to fit seamlessly into each other without any awkward pauses or breaks in sound.

#### 4\. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal

Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don't have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience's minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it's about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don't like singing along with instrumental songs since they don't know what the actual lyrics are.

#### 5\. Think about the emotions you want to convey

The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.

These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It's the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable. The wrong one can ruin it completely.
