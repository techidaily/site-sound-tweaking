## Where To Use a Video Background?

For your video background to be of advantage, these are the places to use it:

## Do and Don'ts When Using Free Video Background

Any video background on your website can reduce website speed, destruct important texts and messages or cause a drop in conversion rate. It’s therefore important to learn where to draw the lines when using background videos.

Here are the best five tips to help use free video backgrounds the right way.

* **Use short video of low bitrate**

To avoid buffering of the video and affecting the speed of your website page negatively, consider using background videos that are 2MB or less. A three-second video is good enough to make a website homepage or video background stunning.

* **Use loopable video background**

Setting your website background video to play in loops is one way of ensuring the video is short. The other preferred option is setting the video background to play continuously. This tends to work better as it does not affect the CPU functionality.

* **Use slow-motion videos**

Fast-moving video backgrounds are destructive and in some cases reduce the content conversion rate. To avoid visitors sticking to the video background for long, reduce the movements.

* **Use compressed background videos**

A compressed video has a low bitrate and therefore plays smoothly without affecting the page load speed. It’s good to compress the video to 720 pixels. Even though high pixel videos are of the best quality, avoid them completely.

* **Use an overlay**

To hide poor quality videos or very bright background videos, use an overlay on top of the video. A semitransparent overlay makes the video more attractive, engaging and creates more interest to look at, as the details are not clearly visible.

## Do and Don'ts When Using Free Video Background

Any video background on your website can reduce website speed, destruct important texts and messages or cause a drop in conversion rate. It’s therefore important to learn where to draw the lines when using background videos.

Here are the best five tips to help use free video backgrounds the right way.

* **Use short video of low bitrate**

To avoid buffering of the video and affecting the speed of your website page negatively, consider using background videos that are 2MB or less. A three-second video is good enough to make a website homepage or video background stunning.

* **Use loopable video background**

Setting your website background video to play in loops is one way of ensuring the video is short. The other preferred option is setting the video background to play continuously. This tends to work better as it does not affect the CPU functionality.

* **Use slow-motion videos**

Fast-moving video backgrounds are destructive and in some cases reduce the content conversion rate. To avoid visitors sticking to the video background for long, reduce the movements.

* **Use compressed background videos**

A compressed video has a low bitrate and therefore plays smoothly without affecting the page load speed. It’s good to compress the video to 720 pixels. Even though high pixel videos are of the best quality, avoid them completely.

* **Use an overlay**

To hide poor quality videos or very bright background videos, use an overlay on top of the video. A semitransparent overlay makes the video more attractive, engaging and creates more interest to look at, as the details are not clearly visible.
