### **Step 2: Import the Audio Track**

![import audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-2.JPG)

### **Step 3: Select Audio Track**

![file import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-3.JPG)

### **Step 4: Export as MP3**

Backup the file so that you still have the whole song available for use later. Go to File > Export > Export as MP3\. Audacity will export the track in the original file format.
