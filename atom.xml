Pexels is an online creative assets library that features high-resolution photos, including Pexels 4k, and an assortment of audio clips you can use in your creations.</p><p>The following are things you need to know about Pexels.com. It includes details on what Pexels is, important user information, and other hidden features of the website. Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use"><a href="#Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?"></a>Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?</h2><p>Yes, Pexels.com is a free online library of stock photos that you can use for personal or commercial purposes with your creations. In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.</p><p>Pexels’ free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.</p><p>According to the site’s founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:</p><ul><li>Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.</li><li>You can also donate to the website’s operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.</li><li>Most of the site’s contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li></ul><p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p><p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.</p><p>Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device. In addition, you can also access the asset library through the Canva application following their merger. Furthermore, you can also download it as a plugin for different content creation software, including Photoshop, MS Office, and Google Slides.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you"><a href="#Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What can Pexels provide you?"></a>Part2: What can Pexels provide you?</h2><p>Now that you are aware of Pexels.com’s origin story and access methods, here is a rundown of what free access provides you.</p><h3 id="1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics"><a href="#1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K images for almost all topics"></a>1. 4K images for almost all topics</h3><p>Pexels.com features a dedicated library of over 40,000 4k images from their contributors. You can access the library by typing 4k in the site’s search engine. In addition, the library is full of 4k images across various topics, including niche subjects such as Nebula and Abstract. Furthermore, the site’s search engine uses search tags to provide more accurate results. For example, by typing 4K Dark in the search engine, the site can narrow down your search to provide more relevant results.</p><h3 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio"></a>2. Audio</h3><p>You also get access to Pexels audio, a collection of over 8000 audio clips from the site’s numerous contributors. In addition, all of the Pexels audio’s content is completely free to use for all users. Currently, you can only access the database through your web browser and the iOS app.</p><h3 id="3-Video"><a href="#3-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Video"></a>3. Video</h3><p>Another content category that your free access provides you is Pexels video. The database features a collection of over 2000 video clips you can use for your commercial or personal works. In addition, Pexels.com offers various editing tools to make alterations immediately. Furthermore, you also have templates for different content configurations, including social media and YouTube posts.</p><h2 id="Part3-What’s-Leaderboard-and-Challenges-on-Pexels-com"><a href="#Part3-What’s-Leaderboard-and-Challenges-on-Pexels-com" class="headerlink" title="Part3: What’s Leaderboard and Challenges on Pexels.com?"></a>Part3: What’s Leaderboard and Challenges on Pexels.com?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-2.jpg"                      alt="leaderboard"                ></p><p>The Pexels free download leaderboard is a list of the site’s top contributors within the past thirty days. The ranking is based on the number of views of photos and videos you submit within thirty days. For example, you earn the top spot if you receive the most views to your content, provided it is less than thirty days old. As such, each contributor has an equal chance of rising to the top, provided they put in the effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-3.jpg"                      alt="pexels"                ></p><p>On the other hand, Pexels challenges are monthly competitions where contributors submit their best work to win different prizes. Typically, each challenge varies in the category, prizes, and content specifications. For example, the most recent challenge required contributors to upload images projecting friendship.</p><p>In addition, there is no limitation to the number of eligible uploads because challenge officials consider all of them. Finally, all images you submit for the Pexels challenge fall under the Pexels license, meaning they are free to use by the site’s visitors.</p><h2 id="Part4-What-are-not-allowed-on-Pexels"><a href="#Part4-What-are-not-allowed-on-Pexels" class="headerlink" title="Part4: What are not allowed on Pexels?"></a>Part4: What are not allowed on Pexels?</h2><p>Currently, all of the Pexels creative assets are under the Pexels license, a variation to the creative commons zero license other stock photo sites offer. Although you can access and download the site’s assets for free, there are some restrictions on your usage of them. Here is what Pexels.com’s free download license does not allow you to do with its assets.</p><h3 id="1-It-can’t-be-used-in-a-political-context"><a href="#1-It-can’t-be-used-in-a-political-context" class="headerlink" title="1. It can’t be used in a political context"></a>1. It can’t be used in a political context</h3><p>You cannot use Pexels free download videos, images, and audio clips in a political context. This is because some of the assets include identifiable people, and using their image may be seen as their endorsement of your political beliefs. In addition, the situation becomes worse if your ideology contains offensive material and messaging.</p><p>Furthermore, the Pexels license also bans using their creative assets to promote your personal brand, especially when they contain any identifiable imagery. By doing so, Pexels.com remains a free resource for people of all creeds, regardless of their political affiliations.</p><h3 id="2-Resell-the-resources"><a href="#2-Resell-the-resources" class="headerlink" title="2. Resell the resources"></a>2. Resell the resources</h3><p>Another thing you cannot do when using Pexels.com is to resell their photos and videos to other stock photograph platforms. Most users attribute this to the site’s owners wanting to maintain a fresher database than its competitors.</p><p>In addition, you can also consider the restriction as a way to prevent duplication of results on web searches and prevent the overuse of creative assets. As such, you cannot use their creative assets on items such as print media and physical goods, including T-shirts and mugs.</p><h2 id="Part5-FAQs"><a href="#Part5-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part5: FAQs"></a>Part5: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Why-should-you-create-a-Pexels-account"><a href="#Why-should-you-create-a-Pexels-account" class="headerlink" title="Why should you create a Pexels account?"></a>Why should you create a Pexels account?</h3><p>Pexels.com seeks to create a simple and fast medium for you to discover free photos and videos. It does so by providing a common platform where contributors can share their work with a greater audience. Here are some of the benefits of creating a Pexels.com account:</p><ul><li>You can create collections for different projects, accessible on different dashboards.</li><li>Continuous free access to every creative asset you have ever downloaded. For example, you can access all images you have downloaded from Pexels 4K.</li><li>You also get a custom homepage that features your latest work and database favorites.</li><li>In addition, you will have access to the site’s community, which has helpful information for all users.</li></ul><h3 id="What-are-the-rules-for-uploading-videos-on-Pexels-com"><a href="#What-are-the-rules-for-uploading-videos-on-Pexels-com" class="headerlink" title="What are the rules for uploading videos on Pexels.com?"></a>What are the rules for uploading videos on Pexels.com?</h3><p>Here are the requirements for uploading videos on Pexels.com:</p><ul><li>Your videos must be of resolution 1920 X 1080 and higher.</li><li>All videos should be free of explicit content such as nudity or violence.</li><li>Your videos should not feature any watermarks, branding, or borders.</li><li>The recording and scene transitions should be seamless.</li><li>The site does not permit the uploading of animations.</li></ul><h3 id="What-are-the-image-uploading-requirements-on-Pexels-com"><a href="#What-are-the-image-uploading-requirements-on-Pexels-com" class="headerlink" title="What are the image uploading requirements on Pexels.com?"></a>What are the image uploading requirements on Pexels.com?</h3><p>Pexels free download accepts images in JPEG format only. In addition, your images must also meet the following conditions.</p><ul><li>All photos need to be at least 4 megapixels and have a minimum resolution of 2592 X 1520 pixels.</li><li>Your images should not contain any explicit material.

Using the app, you can upload images from your smartphone’s internal storage directly to Pexels.com. In addition, other requirements must be met before your photo is approved. You can find out more from the upload guidelines on pexel.com.</p><h3 id="What-alterations-can-you-make-to-use-Pexels-photos-on-your-merchandise"><a href="#What-alterations-can-you-make-to-use-Pexels-photos-on-your-merchandise" class="headerlink" title="What alterations can you make to use Pexels photos on your merchandise?"></a>What alterations can you make to use Pexels photos on your merchandise?</h3><p>Pexels allows you to use its images for personal and commercial reasons if you alter them and make them your own.

Although we have enough eBooks on the market, it also requires some effort and time to be invested. Most of the people are bothered by not reading enough.</p><p>Maybe that is why we have witnessed tremendous growth of audiobooks in the past three years. And as a result, the development of the audiobook market per year is found to be 30%. That implies the audiobook market is growing almost four times faster than the eBook market.</p><p>So, don’t you see the necessity to publish your piece of writing in the form of an audiobook, as well?</p><p>Are you now wondering <strong>how to make an audiobook</strong>? It involves no rocket science, but the process is a bit hard than publishing in Kindle. Here are all your queries answered, and you will learn <strong>how to make your own audiobook</strong> by the end of this article.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Making an Audiobook?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Making-an-Audiobook"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Making-an-Audiobook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Making an Audiobook?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Making an Audiobook?</h2><p>The benefits of getting your book published in the format of an audiobook are numerous. You are missing out on audiences and profit if you constrain the publication of your book just into the form of paperbacks or eBooks. Nowadays, audiobooks actually make more sense with a large number of audiobook listeners worldwide.</p><p>Here are some potential advantages of audiobooks and why you should learn how to create an audiobook:</p><h4 id="1-More-profit"><a href="#1-More-profit" class="headerlink" title="1.More profit"></a>1.More profit</h4><p>According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.</p><p>Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side.

Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly.

But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p><p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p><ul><li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li><li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose.

You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li><li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li></ul><p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p><p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook.

After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p><p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%.

How does Google Podcast work? Its features, interface, and some of the best podcasts are featured on the platform. As a bonus, we will also provide a step-by-step guide on creating your own podcast and submitting it to Google Podcasts.</p><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Best Podcast on Art &amp; Culture</a></li><li><a href="#part4-2">Best Tech Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="#part4-3">Best Talkshow and Interview Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="#part4-4">Best Health Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part4-5">Best History Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part4-6">Best Informative Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part4-7">Best News &amp; Politics Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part4-8">Best Sports Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="#part4-9">Miscellaneous Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="#part4-10">Movies, Music, and TV Podcasts</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part5">How to Record Your Podcast Show for Google Podcast App?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Hot FAQs on the Google Podcast App</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Google-Podcast-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Google-Podcast-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Google Podcast App?"></a>Part 1. What is Google Podcast App?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-1.jpg"                      alt="google podcast interface"                ></p><p>Google Podcast (formerly Google Play Podcast) is Google’s proprietary podcast-listening app. It comes pre-installed on some Android smartphones and all Pixel editions. Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It’s free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.</p><p>Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features"><a href="#Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Google Podcasts Features"></a>Part 2: Google Podcasts Features</h2><p>Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.</p><p>Search and Personalized Recommendations</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg"                      alt="google podcast search"                ></p><p>The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that’s where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.</p><p>Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.</p><p>Free and Ad-free Experience</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg"                      alt="google podcast ad free"                ></p><p>Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google’s standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.</p><p>Clean UI</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg"                      alt="google podcast interface"                ></p><p>Whether you’ve used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.</p><p>In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.</p><p>One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.</p><p>Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-5.jpg"                      alt="google podcast downloads"                ></p><p>Google Podcast automatically downloads the podcasts you love and removes them after you’ve listened to the particular episodes.</p><p>Another significant characteristic of the Google Podcast platform is its intuitiveness. For instance, many podcast platforms do not automatically switch to the next episode, but you do not have to worry about such aspects with Google Podcast. You can also put a sleep timer.</p><p>Given that it’s available on all primary OS, you can seamlessly switch from one device to another. Not to forget, you can search for the podcasts using Google search or your Voice Assitant.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Does-Google-Podcast-Work"><a href="#Part-3-How-Does-Google-Podcast-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Does Google Podcast Work?"></a>Part 3: How Does Google Podcast Work?</h2><p>Now that you know the Google Podcast app and its features, here’s how to use the platform.

The Pause icon allows you to interrupt the episode. Plus, the 10 seconds rewind button allows you to go back and listen to something again.</p><p>Whereas the 30 seconds forward button will enable you to jump 30 seconds ahead in the episode, you can use this icon during the introduction or in-episode ads. The Speed icon lets you change the playback speed from 0.5x to 3x.</p><p>The “half-moon” icon allows you to set a sleep timer. And the “Info.” icon allows you to read about the individual podcasts (if published by the creators).

And the share button allows you to share the episode with others.</p><h5 id="Step4-Queues-and-Downloads-menu-in-the-Google-Podcast-App"><a href="#Step4-Queues-and-Downloads-menu-in-the-Google-Podcast-App" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Queues and Downloads menu in the Google Podcast App"></a>Step4 Queues and Downloads menu in the Google Podcast App</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-9.jpg"                      alt="google podcast downloads"                ></p><p>Given that the Google Podcast is a free platform, you can download all the episodes and listen to them offline. To download the episodes, click on the Download button. Once downloaded, you can access them via the three-lined icon from the bottom-right of the interface. Within the Library tab, you will also find the History tab, which allows you to access all the episodes you’ve previously listened to.</p><h5 id="Step5-Settings-in-the-Google-Podcast-platform"><a href="#Step5-Settings-in-the-Google-Podcast-platform" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Settings in the Google Podcast platform"></a>Step5 Settings in the Google Podcast platform</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-10.jpg"                      alt="google podcast settings"                ></p><p>Click on your image at the top-right corner to access the Settings in the Google Podcast app. Under the Google Podcast Settings page, you will find options for Downloads, Notifications, Playback, and more.

Usually, four different types of tools were used to perform different operations on a single music track.

Pick the Right Location"></a>1. Pick the Right Location</h3><p>If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don’t need much effort.

Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.</p><p><strong>Noise reduction</strong> is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.</p><p>The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do <strong>noise reduction in Audacity</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity" >PCmag review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:</p><ul><li>The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li><li>If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audacity-noise-reduction.jpg"                      alt="audacity noise reduction"                ></p><ul><li>Once a new window labelled ‘STEP 1’ opens, click on the ‘GET NOISE PROFILE’ button. This creates the NOISE PROFILE which Audacity will use in the noise reduction process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/apply-noise-reduction.jpg"                      alt="apply audacity noise reduction"                ></p><ul><li>Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.</li><li>When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/set-how-to-reduce-noise.jpg"                      alt="manually reduce noise"                ></p><ul><li>Now, click the PREVIEW button to hear the effect of your noise reduction settings. If you are not satisfied with the preview, you can adjust the settings bars until you achieve a good result.</li><li>You should also click on the RESIDUE radio button to hear the sounds that will be eliminated from your recording if your chosen settings are applied.

If you want your video to appeal to everyone and bring people more joy, then you might want to consider these Top 10 Best Montage Songs for Your Montage Video!</p><h2 id="How-A-Well-Picked-Song-Enhances-Your-Montage-Video"><a href="#How-A-Well-Picked-Song-Enhances-Your-Montage-Video" class="headerlink" title="How A Well-Picked Song Enhances Your Montage Video"></a>How A Well-Picked Song Enhances Your Montage Video</h2><p>If you have ever been to YouTube and searched for montage videos, then you must have noticed that they all have one thing in common. They have a great soundtrack.</p><p>The music is what makes the montage video so special. The right song can make your montage video go viral, while the wrong one can make it fail miserably.</p><p>Here are some tips to help you pick the right music for your next montage:</p><h4 id="1-Choose-music-that-matches-the-mood-of-your-video"><a href="#1-Choose-music-that-matches-the-mood-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose music that matches the mood of your video"></a>1. Choose music that matches the mood of your video</h4><p>Many people make the mistake of choosing songs that don’t fit their videos at all. For example, if you’re making a movie about love and romance, it doesn’t make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.</p><h4 id="2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video"><a href="#2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="2. Pick songs that match the genre of your video"></a>2. Pick songs that match the genre of your video</h4><p>If you’re making a romantic comedy movie, then try picking up some romantic pop songs instead of heavy metal ones or classical ones. This way, your viewers will know right away what type of movie they’re watching and will be able to enjoy themselves more because they know what to expect from it visually and audibly.</p><h4 id="3-The-length-of-your-montage-video"><a href="#3-The-length-of-your-montage-video" class="headerlink" title="3. The length of your montage video"></a>3. The length of your montage video</h4><p>If you have a long montage video (over 1 minute), you may want to use shorter songs (under 3 minutes) to fit seamlessly into each other without any awkward pauses or breaks in sound.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-in-mind-that-there-are-two-types-of-songs-instrumental-and-vocal"><a href="#4-Keep-in-mind-that-there-are-two-types-of-songs-instrumental-and-vocal" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal"></a>4. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal</h4><p>Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don’t have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience’s minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it’s about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don’t like singing along with instrumental songs since they don’t know what the actual lyrics are.</p><h4 id="5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey"><a href="#5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey" class="headerlink" title="5. Think about the emotions you want to convey"></a>5. Think about the emotions you want to convey</h4><p>The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.</p><p>These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It’s the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable.
