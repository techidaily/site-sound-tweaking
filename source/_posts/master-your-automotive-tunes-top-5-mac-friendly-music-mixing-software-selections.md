* With upcoming details, you will get detailed information about all these methods.

### Method 1: Create Or Compose Own Sound Effects

In some cases, people don’t find the sound effect or audio as they really want or plan to feature in the video. It is the main reason why people start investing more time in research. If you face these types of conditions, you should pick the option of creating your own effects. For all these things, you should have technical knowledge of music, such as – tempo, pitch, and so on. It will help you get the desired results and save lots of time that you may spend searching for the best options.

![Create Own Dog Sound Effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/clap-2.png)

### Method 2: Get From YouTube Sourc

YouTube has lots of entertaining content, such as – different types of videos. Now, YouTube Audio Library is also available for music lovers. You can consider YouTube for searching for a suitable match. On YouTube, you will get lots of variations regarding sound effects and all. When it comes to dealing with it, you need to be careful and smart. Using YouTube Audio Library is not easy as other sources. Here, you cannot download or use all types of audio files freely.

The users need to be focused on the copyright policy carefully. Some audio files are free from copyright restrictions. In case you find any YouTube video with suitable sound effects, you can use online sources to download and convert it into MP3.

![Use YouTube For Dog Sound Effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dog-sound-2.png)

### Method 3: Use Third-Party Sources

In case you are not getting satisfied with the previous two methods, you should be focused on third-party sources. Generally, these specific sources are available in the form of online platforms or websites. These websites are having big audio libraries with different types of sound effects and audio files. The biggest factor about all these things is related to the service type. The users don’t have to spend a single penny on it and are allowed to download the desired content as well.

Here, you should be focused on choosing the best service provider only. You may face some bad or scammer platforms as well. Try to be smart and careful while making a final decision.
