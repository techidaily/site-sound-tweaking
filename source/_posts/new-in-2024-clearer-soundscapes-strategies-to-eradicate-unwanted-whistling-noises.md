## **Part 1\. Audio Hiss: What is it and Why Remove it**

A hiss is a broadband noise across the audible spectrum of your audio. It becomes more intense in high frequencies, affecting the quality of the vocals and instrumentals in your audio. A hiss could sound like blue noise and is often caused by the electronic components themselves, which is referred to as self or inherent noise.

![hiss in audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-reverb-from-audio-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

A hiss is measured by decibels and is usually difficult to avoid because it is produced by electronic components. You will usually hear the hiss as air that is getting out of a narrow passage. You may also hear a reverb, which is a sound that occurs in space and sends sound waves out in all directions. Since this is a component of the original recording, it is impossible to delete it. However, hiss reduction is possible with the right editing software.

### **Causes of Hiss in Audio Recordings**

* Electronic components such as microphones, video cameras, and interfaces create self-noise because of the heat energy created by the moving parts
* Audio circuits generate self-noise, with the noise floor being the level of the inherent noise in the circuit
* Screening and quality of electronic components, which cheap and poorly made equipment producing more hiss
* Poor-quality audio cables contribute to hiss and hum when they are picked up during recording

### **Importance of Removing Hiss for a Professional Sound**

Removing hiss from audio is important for a professional sound because it makes the sound clearer and polished. The polished sound leads to

* Improved clarity and focus on the main vocals or instruments in a recording sound
* A more professional and smooth sound
* Increases listener engagement
* More understandable vocals and more vibrant instrumentals

## **Part 4\. Tips and Tricks to Avoid Hiss and Reverb Noise**

The problem of hissing sound and reverb noise usually comes from the equipment itself. However, some background noise may add to the problem. Making a few adjustments to the recording stage may help in reducing hiss and background noise:

* **Optimize the Recording Space**

The noise-producing items in your recording space may add to the hissing noise in your audio. While most of the noise may seem innocent, they may amplify themselves when listening to the recorded footage. Optimizing your space before you start, such as closing the windows and doors or turning off your electronic devices will help to reduce the noise.

* **Reduce Subject-to-Microphone Distance**

Keeping the microphone as close as possible to the subject will drastically improve the speech-to-noise ratio. The microphone will record more of the subject’s voice than the background noise, giving you a clearer audio output.

* **Use a Microphone with Gain-Boost**

An enhanced gain microphone preamp helps to reduce hiss and notice from the audio in an incredible way. Specifically, the camera’s preamplifier does not add gain because the volume setting is kept low.

* **Use Directional Microphones**

Usually, microphones signal outside their axis. This is often the case for cardioid polar and short gun patterns. This quality is great for reducing noise when you use directional microphones. The microphone will only focus on what you are interested in, ignoring the background noise.

* **Turn Off Camera’s Auto-Gain**

The AGC or Auto Gain Control feature is popular in modern cameras. It automatically adjusts the gain for low- and high-volume sounds to make them even. However, it can enhance everything for a quiet setting, causing hissing background noise. Turning the feature off gives you more control over what sounds to focus on.

* **Reduce the Number of Open Microphones**

Open microphones will continue recording audio even when you are not interested in that sound. Keeping this number low will help reduce hissing sound by focusing only on what you are recording.

## **Conclusion**

Hiss and reverb background noise is an annoying problem. The unwanted sounds affect the quality of your audio and the level of engagement in your footage. While eliminating causes of hiss when recording is the best way to reduce it, sometimes you may notice when it is too late. Using the right editing software will help you reduce the noise and improve the quality of your audio. Wondershare Filmora allows you to do this with the AI Audio Denoise feature. The AI-powered feature will automatically reduce hiss noise and reverb in your clips, giving you clearer and more engaging audio.
