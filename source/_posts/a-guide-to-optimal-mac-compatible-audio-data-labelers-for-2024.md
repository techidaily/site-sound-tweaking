With more than 203 million daily users, Snapchat is one of the largest messaging platforms on the market. Previously, we've shared [how to change gender on Snapchat](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), beside that, the app lets its users capture short moments or the so-called Snaps and share them with friends. In addition to hundreds of [video filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Snapchat also features a broad spectrum of voice changing effects that make Snaps more entertaining.
