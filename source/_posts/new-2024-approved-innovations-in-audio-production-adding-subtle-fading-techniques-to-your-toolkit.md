### Youtube Audio Library

You may find YouTube’s Audio Library under the "Create" feature. It includes a diverse range of musical styles. You are free to utilize any music in your video project.

The soundtrack is a combination of public domain, and Creative Commons licensed pieces. All you would need to do is credit the track's creator.

Just use library's search capabilities taking full advantage of it. You may, for example, search by emotion, such like "happy," "sad," or "boss battle." You may search for tracks based on their duration, which is a fantastic way to ensure that they suit the timeframe of your material.

Some other component on YouTube worth looking at would be their Music Policies section. Now you'll come across a number of famous tunes and also information about whether or not you're authorized to utilize them in YouTube videos and how to do so.
