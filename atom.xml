Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors"><a href="#Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Online Audio Extractors"></a>Top 6 Online Audio Extractors</h2><p>The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors. So, before you decide which platform you are going to use, you must first check the size and file format of your video. Let’s take a look at some of the best online audio extractors you can use to create high-quality audio files for free.</p><h4 id="2-Online-Audio-Converter"><a href="#2-Online-Audio-Converter" class="headerlink" title="2.

The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is <strong>2048mb</strong>, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or some other online destination, you just have to select the <strong>output format</strong> and <strong>the quality</strong> of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on <strong>the Advanced settings option</strong> if you would like to add <strong>fade in and fade out effects</strong>, try to <strong>remove voice</strong> or change the <strong>bitrates and sample rates</strong>. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> when ready and proceed to <strong>save the file</strong> to your computer or at some online destination.</p><h4 id="3-AudioExtracter"><a href="#3-AudioExtracter" class="headerlink" title="3.

AudioExtracter</h4><p>This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files <strong>automatically</strong>, but it also offers a variety of <strong>video, photo and audio editing tools</strong> you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in <strong>MP4, AVI</strong> or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than <strong>500mb</strong> and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an <strong>output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file</strong> you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to <strong>convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,</strong> so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.</p><h4 id="4-Online-Video-Converter"><a href="#4-Online-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4.

In nutshell, it is a process in which the background sound of a clip is reduced and the voiceover is amplified. Therefore, with the help of sound ducking, we can focus on the dialogues without a noisy background track.</p><p>Lately, a lot of people have asked us about the process to do automatic audio ducking in <strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong>. Since it is a clip-based editing tool, it lacks a dedicated mixer to help us do FCPX audio ducking. Thankfully, there are third-party plugins and tools (like the <strong>FCPX AutoDuck</strong>) that can help us do the same. In this post, I will let you know how to do audio ducking in Final Cut Pro and its best alternative.</p><p>If you don’t want to use any plugins, see this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to sync in FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>If you have a video in which you have background music and a voiceover, then you can perform sound ducking in it. This will automatically enhance the quality of the voiceover and would mellow down the background music selectively. Sadly, the feature of audio ducking in Final Cut Pro has to be done manually as there are no instant automatic options in the tool presently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-1.jpg"                      alt="Audio Ducking Process"                ></p><p>Therefore, you can use any reliable third-party FCPX tool like Audified or AutoDuck to meet your requirements. For instance, let’s consider the example of FCPX AutoDuck, which is a paid macOS application. To perform FCPX audio ducking, you first have to export the music and voiceover as two dedicated files. Later, you can import them to FCPX AutoDuck to perform auto-ducking of the music.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files"><a href="#Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Export the Music Files"></a>Step 1: Export the Music Files</h4><p>To perform audio ducking in Final Cut Pro, you can first launch the application on Mac and open your project. Since there is no FCPX audio ducking option, you first have to export the music files.</p><p>For this, you can just go to the main menu on Final Cut Pro and select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Share</strong> &gt; <strong>Master File</strong>. This will help you explore and save all the media files from Final Cut Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-2.jpg"                      alt="Final Cut Pro Master Files"                ></p><p>Now, once the Master File window would be opened, you can go to the “Role” tab and select “Audio Only” as the output role. This will display a list of the background music and the voiceover file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-3.jpg"                      alt="Export Audio Tracks"                ></p><p>You can now select the files of your choice and click on the “Next” button to save them to any desired location on your Mac.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking"><a href="#Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking"></a>Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking</h4><p>Great! Now, you can just open the FCPX AutoDuck application on your Mac via its Application or Spotlight. You can just give it a project name and drag-and-drop the speaker (voiceover) and the music files here. If you want, you can also import a filler file of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-4.jpg"                      alt="FCPX AutoDuck Process"                ></p><p>FCPX will also let you select the level of music ducking from its dedication option.

Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn’t be taken lightly since the video’s reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.</p><p> Let’s have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.</p><h2 id="How-to-add-audio-to-video-in-Magix-Movie-Edit-Pro"><a href="#How-to-add-audio-to-video-in-Magix-Movie-Edit-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro"></a>How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro</h2><p> Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don’t match the video the final result will be barely watchable.</p><h4 id="1-Import-the-video-clip-and-separate-the-video-and-audio"><a href="#1-Import-the-video-clip-and-separate-the-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio"></a>1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG"                      alt="magix-size-position"                ></p><p> All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn’t displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro’s timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the ‘Import’ tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the ‘Ungroup’ icon on the editor’s timeline.</p><h4 id="2-Remove-and-replace-the-files-on-the-audio-track"><a href="#2-Remove-and-replace-the-files-on-the-audio-track" class="headerlink" title="2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track"></a>2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track</h4><p> After clicking on the ‘Ungroup’ icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor’s audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the ‘Delete’ button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the ‘Split objects’ icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.</p><p> Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the ‘Import’ tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don’t want to use by clicking on the ‘’Split objects’ icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.</p><h4 id="3-Edit-the-audio-files"><a href="#3-Edit-the-audio-files" class="headerlink" title="3.Edit the audio files"></a>3.Edit the audio files</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-audio-effects.JPG"                      alt="magix-size-position"                ></p><p> Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the ‘Effects’ tab and slide down to the ‘Audio Effects’ section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the ‘Audio Effects’ option.
