**Budget** – [Considering the budget is at the top of the list](https://www.payoff.com/life/money/5-simple-steps-to-create-a-successful-budget/) in the music equipment guides.

Before opting for the paid versions of these music production software for Windows and Mac, it is always better to check the trial version of it and then, go ahead with the purchase only if you are satisfied.
