## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Bonus Section: How to Adjust Sound Louder in Audacity?

Volume in an audio file may or may not be ideal for use. Sometimes, the sound is too loud or low. Audacity can help you in such a situation. So, if you are editing sound recordings in Audacity, you can also fix the volume of the sound. The good thing to note is that you can adjust the sound in both directions, which implies you can easily amplify or reduce the volume in these open-source applications. Are you interested in knowing about the volume adjustment process in Audacity? If yes, we have summarized the process in simple steps. Let’s take a look.

**Step 1:** **Add an audio file**

Launch the software and click on **File**. Select **Open** and select the desired audio.
