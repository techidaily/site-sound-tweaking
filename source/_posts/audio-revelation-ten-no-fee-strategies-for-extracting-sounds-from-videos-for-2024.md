Secondly, you have to waste your internet data to upload and download files. At times, the uploading gets stuck which could be annoying. Besides, you cannot edit different aspects of audio to enhance the overall pleasantness of the audio. That is where a professional audio editor can be useful.

We recommend Wondershare [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where you can edit audio and video as per requirement. The software supports various types of audio files instead of just MP3 files. You can combine and sync audio and video and edit all the different aspects of audio as per requirement. Here are the steps to boost audio volume using Filmora.

Starting from boosting the background music to increasing and decreasing voice, you can modify MP3 as well as other audio files. If you are looking for a professional software to tweak various aspects of audio, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.
