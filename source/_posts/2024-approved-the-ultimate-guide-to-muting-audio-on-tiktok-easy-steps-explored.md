# Normalizing Audio in 3 Quick Ways-Audio Normalization

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

## 15 Top Montage Music for Different Video Types

Montage is a film editing technique that combines a series of clips or shots into a single sequence. Background music is often applied to the final montage during compilation. We'll look at some of the best montage music for different video types and the benefits of adding them to your montage video.

## Why Music Is Important for Montage Video

Music plays an essential role in montage videos. Here are five reasons why you should add music to your montage video.

#### 1\. Music Captures Attention

One of the reasons people include music in montage videos is that it holds the audience's attention; it shapes emotion while motivating viewers.

#### 2\. Music Takes Your Montage Video to the Next Level

By using music, you'll boost the cohesiveness and production value of your montage video. Your audience wants a professional montage video that is well-constructed and flows nicely. Music is the bridge that lets your montage video transition seamlessly between different scenes or ideas, particularly when you need to have a jump cut.

Additionally, montage music is a great way to fill in moments in your montage video that would have been silent. You can also use it to fill dead air in your video where there is a visual without sound.

#### 3\. Music Helps You to Communicate Your Message

Music is a vital component in conveying your message in your montage video. The music in your video should be in tune with the message you are trying to send.

#### 4\. Helps to Underscore the Unfolding Action

Montage music helps you to emphasize the action taking place in your video. As a result, this will make your audience focus on the action and get your message.

#### 5\. Helps You Create Rhythm for Your Montage Video

Music allows you to create a rhythm for scenes and clips in your montage video. A good rhythm can hold up your entire montage video.
