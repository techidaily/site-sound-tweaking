When it comes to producing music, audio effects are a next-level creative tool that you can make use of to create highly enthralling and creative music/videos.

You can either create audio effects of your own or make use of a predefined [royalty-free audio effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) template (if you don't wish to invest, as a beginner).

Audio effects have the power to transform any so-so music into a superior finished track.

For this reason, we've specifically tailored this post to help you understand the insights of audio effects. Moreover, we're also going to get familiar with 7 audio effects that must be known! So, let's not delay any further and start exploring.

* [Part 1: The Definition of Audio Effects](#part1)
* [Part 2: Audio effects - Reverb](#part2)
* [Part 3: Audio effects - Panning](#part3)
* [Part 4: Audio effects - Equalization](#part4)
* [Part 5: Audio effects - Delay and Echo](#part5)
* [Part 6: Audio effects - Distortion](#part6)
* [Part 7: Audio effects - Chorus](#part7)
* [Part 8: Audio effects - Filters](#part8)

## Part 1: The Definition of Audio Effects

Before we get our hands on the different core types of audio effects, we should first understand what audio effects are!

Basically, the audio effects are generated by software or hardware devices by manipulating how an audio signal sounds. One can control the Effects with the help of several parameters.

For instance, rate, drive, or feedback. They come in handy as studio tools during the mixing or recording of music or while playing live.

Here are some core types of audio effects we will discover further in the article.

* Time-based effects include "Reverb" and "Delay and Echo."
* Spectral effects include the "Equalization (EQ)" and "Panning."
* Dynamic effects include "Distortion."
* Modulation effects include "Chorus."
* And "Filters."

## Part 2: Audio effects - Reverb

[Reverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation) is nothing but an audio effect of many echoes occurring simultaneously.

In other words, sound reaches your ears in two ways. One that directly reaches your eardrums without any obstacles or surfaces.

And the other, a bunch of sound waves that reach your ears after getting bounced off different surfaces. This set of echoes reach your eardrums later and is quieter (due to lesser energy).

![aduio effects reverb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/reverb.jpg)

You may experience different types of reverb audio effects for different kinds of spaces. Basically, Reverb stands for Reverberation. It happens quite always in our daily life, but we hardly notice it.

For instance, Reverb at tunnels or caves is different from the reverb audio effect of cathedrals or halls.

Reverb audio effects can be generated digitally with the help of [reverb plugins](https://iconcollective.com/top-reverb-plugins/) to create multiple echoes algorithmically and by manipulating the Delay, level, or frequency response.

## Part 3: Audio effects - Panning

The panning audio effect is generally created to cast an illusion that the source of the sound is moving from one position of the stage to another. This is achieved by distributing the sound signal in a multichannel or a stereo field.

Panning audio effect is highly helpful when you need to avoid muddiness or masking (when two tracks/sounds overlap) in your mix. You can position the sound artificially to a specific area of your stereo field.

![panning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/panning.jpg)

With the help of an auto-pan, you can define the time span during which the sound must sweep across the stereo field.

Usually, the lead elements like vocals or the low-frequency elements like bassline drums panned to the center. This is because the center is the busiest, and also these sound elements ground your mix.

## Part 4: Audio effects - Equalization

The sound frequency that falls into the range from 20 to 20,000 Hz is the [audible sound spectrum](https://global.widex.com/en/blog/human-hearing-range-what-can-you-hear) of human ears. With the EQ technique, this spectrum is split into different sections referred to as bands.

These bands are then used to subdue or enhance a mixed track's fragments.

![equalization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/equalization.jpg)

Remember, EQ-ing works on the existing spectrum only by altering the fragments to create novel-sounding effects. EQ audio effects are majorly used to define a character or tone of the soundtrack.

Moreover, you can define different types of sound characters with the help of different EQ audio effects. For instance, a digital plugin EQ is far more transparent sounding when compared to a vintage EQ.

## Part 5: Audio effects - Delay and Echo

Delay is yet another type of audio effect that falls under the Time-based category. Adding layers can significantly provide more complexity and depth to a soundtrack.

The foundation to add Reverb or chorus-like other audio effects is furnished by Delay. Hence, it is prominently utilized by several mixing engineers.

![audio effects delay and echo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/delay-and-echo.jpg)

The echo also falls under the time-based audio effect, which is developed due to the Delay audio effect. An echoing effect is simulated at various intervals when Delay audio effect features playback heads or "taps" that are heard apart.

If you want to edit audios like a pro, you should use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is the best video editor for different users. You can add echo to audio by directly dragging the effect onto the timeline. Download it now to have a try (Free)!

## Part 6: Audio effects - Distortion

When an audio circuit is overloaded, it ultimately leads to a clip the signal is termed as Distortion.

This audio effect can be a highly creative tool if used correctly. Distortion pushes the sound to compress and clip by manipulating the original audio signal.

![distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/distortion.jpg)

By manipulating the bit rate or the sampling rate, Bit-crushing is achieved. This, eventually, adds harmony to the sound.

Usually, the [electric guitars](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/what-makes-an-electric-guitar-sound-like-an-electric-guitar/38644) make use of Distortion audio effect but more progressively it is being used over Synths.

Distortion can be acquired using effects units, rackmounts, pedals, VSTs, or at times, built-in amplifiers and pre-amps. Distortion adds complexity and body to your track by making it fatter and fuller.

## Part 7: Audio effects - Chorus

Chorus audio effect is referred to the varying sounds that are similar and are heard as one.

For instance, recording the same note piled over each other and is timed and tuned slightly off each other.

This as a whole, creates a chorus effect. In simple words, a group of singers is voicing a song while creating a special sound effect.

The chorus, too, adds complexity and depth to your soundtracks. It is generally used to enhance the harmony or load up the particular track, making the track fuller and layered.

## Part 8: Audio effects - Filters

An audio signal's frequency range can be altered using the Audio filters. With the help of an audio filter, you can easily amplify or boost the frequency range.

Or, can even cut or attenuate a frequency range too. When it comes to categorizing the Audio Filters, they fall under 3 units; HPF (High-pass filters), LPF (Low-pass filters), BPF (Band-pass filters).

![filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/filters.jpg)

Every other filter has a well-defined threshold for boosting or cutting a frequency. They are then categorized depending on the alterations that have been made above or below this threshold.

An Audio filter is a prominent tool used to correct problems and significantly enhance tracks. You can effectively make dramatic effects or add character to the soundtrack with filters.

### Conclusion

With this comprehensive discussion on audio effects and various core types of audio effects, it's now time to conclude this topic. We now believe you have a full understanding of these core audio effects and can effectively use them as per your needs.

Remember, EQ-ing works on the existing spectrum only by altering the fragments to create novel-sounding effects. EQ audio effects are majorly used to define a character or tone of the soundtrack.

Moreover, you can define different types of sound characters with the help of different EQ audio effects. For instance, a digital plugin EQ is far more transparent sounding when compared to a vintage EQ.

## Part 5: Audio effects - Delay and Echo

Delay is yet another type of audio effect that falls under the Time-based category. Adding layers can significantly provide more complexity and depth to a soundtrack.

The foundation to add Reverb or chorus-like other audio effects is furnished by Delay. Hence, it is prominently utilized by several mixing engineers.

![audio effects delay and echo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/delay-and-echo.jpg)

The echo also falls under the time-based audio effect, which is developed due to the Delay audio effect. An echoing effect is simulated at various intervals when Delay audio effect features playback heads or "taps" that are heard apart.

If you want to edit audios like a pro, you should use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is the best video editor for different users. You can add echo to audio by directly dragging the effect onto the timeline. Download it now to have a try (Free)!

## Part 6: Audio effects - Distortion

When an audio circuit is overloaded, it ultimately leads to a clip the signal is termed as Distortion.

This audio effect can be a highly creative tool if used correctly. Distortion pushes the sound to compress and clip by manipulating the original audio signal.

![distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/distortion.jpg)

By manipulating the bit rate or the sampling rate, Bit-crushing is achieved. This, eventually, adds harmony to the sound.

Usually, the [electric guitars](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/what-makes-an-electric-guitar-sound-like-an-electric-guitar/38644) make use of Distortion audio effect but more progressively it is being used over Synths.

Distortion can be acquired using effects units, rackmounts, pedals, VSTs, or at times, built-in amplifiers and pre-amps. Distortion adds complexity and body to your track by making it fatter and fuller.

## Part 7: Audio effects - Chorus

Chorus audio effect is referred to the varying sounds that are similar and are heard as one.

For instance, recording the same note piled over each other and is timed and tuned slightly off each other.

This as a whole, creates a chorus effect. In simple words, a group of singers is voicing a song while creating a special sound effect.

The chorus, too, adds complexity and depth to your soundtracks. It is generally used to enhance the harmony or load up the particular track, making the track fuller and layered.

## Part 8: Audio effects - Filters

An audio signal's frequency range can be altered using the Audio filters. With the help of an audio filter, you can easily amplify or boost the frequency range.

Or, can even cut or attenuate a frequency range too. When it comes to categorizing the Audio Filters, they fall under 3 units; HPF (High-pass filters), LPF (Low-pass filters), BPF (Band-pass filters).

![filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/filters.jpg)

Every other filter has a well-defined threshold for boosting or cutting a frequency. They are then categorized depending on the alterations that have been made above or below this threshold.

An Audio filter is a prominent tool used to correct problems and significantly enhance tracks. You can effectively make dramatic effects or add character to the soundtrack with filters.

### Conclusion

With this comprehensive discussion on audio effects and various core types of audio effects, it's now time to conclude this topic. We now believe you have a full understanding of these core audio effects and can effectively use them as per your needs.

## Part 3: How to Trim Music in iMovie on iPhone

This section will offer you a guide on how to cut out parts of audio in an iMovie project on an iPad or iPhone. After adding music to your project, the audio is trimmed to the desired length using iMovieâ€™s inbuilt tool.

**Step #1:** Open iMovie on your iPhone or iPad.

**Step #2:** Tap the movie project you want to edit.

It will display a list of your projects, among which you must select the one you want to edit.

If you want to edit a current section of video not even opened in iMovie, you have to make a new iMovie project to add your audio and video. Select the **+** icon, choose the **Movie** tab, select the video(s), and then choose the **Create movie** button.

**Step #3:** Hit the **Edit** button below the name of your project.

This opens your project in the editor. And, youâ€™re already in the editor if you just created a new project in the previous step.

**Step #4:** Add audio to your project.

You can skip this step if your project already contains the audio. Hit the **+** icon in the upper-left timeline's corner.

Choose **Audio**.

Go with a specific category:

Soundtracks are audio tracks provided by iMovie which are free to use in your project.

Select **My Music** to locate the file and use a song from iTunes or the music app.

Sound effects are shorter soundsâ€”mostly below 10 seconds duration.

Choose an audio file for the preview.

Select the **+** icon to add the file to your project.

**Step #5:** Hit the audio bar on the timeline.

It is present below the multi-frame version of your video in the screenâ€™s bottom area.

Now, detach the MP3 segment or audio from the video by tapping the video on the timeline and selecting the Detach button at the screen's bottom area.

**Step #6:** Tap and drag the beginning of the audio track.

Drag or move the audio track to the exact point where you wish it to start fromâ€”the audio track's left-end marks of the yellow bar starting your audio.

**Step #7:** Tap and drag the end of the audio track.

You can drag the yellow bar at the end and move it to the exact point where you want the audio to end.

If you can't see the yellow bar on the far-right end of the audio track, swipe left below the audio track to scroll to the end.

To move the audio track to another location, select and hold it for about one second, and then move it to the desired videoâ€™s location.

**Step #8:** Select the **Play** tab for preview.

It's the sideways triangle just below the video preview.

**Step #9:** Select the **Done** button when you're finished.

It is present at the screenâ€™s top-left corner. You have now confirmed the changes done to your project.

If you want to play it on any other device, tap the **Share** button at the bottom after choosing the **Done** tab and select **Save Video** to export it.

## Part 4: Audio Editing Tips for iMovie Users

Here are some guidelines or tips for various audio editing processes, starting from cutting trim music on iMovie, using iMovie to trim audio and video together, and other audio and video editing tips.

* **Use Waveforms to See What You Hear**

Sound is just as relevant as the images in a video, and should focus just as much during editing. To efficiently and adequately edit audio, you need a good set of speakers and headphones to hear the sound, and you also need to be able to see the sound.

If the waveforms don't appear, go to the "view" drop-down menu and select "show waveforms", the waveform would show you the sound intensity level of a sound clip and definitely would give you an idea of what part will need to be turned up or down.

* **Audio Adjustments**

With the audio button situated at the top right, you have access to some essential audio editing tools for changing the sound level of your chosen clip or changing the relative volume of other films in the project.

The audio editing window also contains primary noise reduction and audio equalization tools and a range of effects â€“ from robot to echo- which would affect how people sound in your video.

* **Editing Audio with the Timeline**

iMovie permits you to adjust the audio within the clips themselves, each volume as a bar. You can shift up and down to increase or decrease the audio level. The clips also have "fade in" and "fade out" buttons at the beginning and end, which are draggable to adjust the fade length.

## Conclusion

Finally, with the answers to the question, how to cut audio in iMovie, you can follow the simple step guide and feel free to edit your audio or video to your taste using iMovie or Wondershare Filmora.
