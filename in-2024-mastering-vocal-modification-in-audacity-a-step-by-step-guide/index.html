How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a ‘Change Pitch’ feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.</p>
<p>The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3. With Audacity, you also get the ‘To’ and ‘From’ controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the ‘File’ section, you can also ‘Open’ any file from your device.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Arm-your-Track-3"><a href="#Arm-your-Track-3" class="headerlink" title="Arm your Track"></a>Arm your Track</h3><p>Arming your track is very important. For this, head over to the Track Control Panel, and next to your track name, hit the red circle. If you have various tracks, you should solo this track and mute the other tracks.</p>
<p>As soon as the track is armed, a Gain Meter will activate on the side. From this, you can check if you have properly set the microphone or not. This could be tested by tapping on the microphone.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="Record-3"><a href="#Record-3" class="headerlink" title="Record"></a>Record</h3><p>After all, the hardware settings are done, and your track is armed, it’s time to start the recording.

From the items menu, you have to select the option of Split Item on Cursor. This divides your clip into two clips on each side of the cursor. You can also remove the clips by going to the Items Menu. From there, you just have to hit the Remove Item option, or else, simply press the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>

                      alt="split your recorded audio"
                ></p>
<p>Removing clips will create a gap in the arrangement window that can be filled by dragging forward the remaining clip.</p>

A new window will appear as Media Item Properties, from where you have to locate the Volume Settings and then select the option of Normalize.</p>
<p>If your item is already loud, then nothing will happen, but if it is not, then the slider will change from 0.00 dB showing an increase in the volume. Lastly, hit the ‘Apply’ or ‘OK’ button to imply the changes.</p>
<h3 id="Fade-in-out-3"><a href="#Fade-in-out-3" class="headerlink" title="Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Fade in&#x2F;out</h3><p>With the Media Properties, you can also adjust a Fade in and a Fade out.

<h3 id="Automate-Changes-3"><a href="#Automate-Changes-3" class="headerlink" title="Automate Changes"></a>Automate Changes</h3><p>With REAPER, you can also automate changes in track parameters. We will guide about automation from Track Envelopes. From Track Control Panel, hit the Trim option. A new Envelopes window will open at this point from where you have to check the Volume box.</p>
<p>A new Volume Track will open up. Here, you have to set new Envelope points. That could be done by holding the shift key, right-clicking on the point, and then selecting Create New Point. A green circle will indicate the new point.</p>
