#### Section 6: Apply unique Audio Effects

If you want to add specific effects to your audio files then use two simple methods on Vegas Pro with its Audio FX tool: One is to add effects on entire video file and second option is to make changes to specific layers of audio project. Use these steps to achieve great results:
