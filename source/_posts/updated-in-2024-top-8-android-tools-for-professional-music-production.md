 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It has been a little over fifteen years since Ben Hammersley coined the term podcast. During this time, radio and TV stations, as well as people from all walks of life, have embraced this new medium of spreading information through either audio or video files.

Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics. Listening to a podcast from a Smartphone without a player is not an option, which is why we made a selection of some of the best podcast player apps for iPhone and Android devices.

## Best Free Podcast Player Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Nearly all **podcast player apps** have similar features. You can discover new shows, limit how many episodes can be downloaded to your device or reduce silences to the very minimum.

The list of features a podcast player provides should help you determine if that app is the right choice for you. Here are some of the best free podcast player apps for iOS and Android devices you can find on the market in 2019.

![Best Podcast Player App - Pocket Casts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pocket-casts-podcast-player.jpg)

The app’s functional design makes it easy to find and manage podcasts by enabling you to create playback queues effortlessly. **Trimming silence, skipping intros or streaming episodes** without downloading them are just a few among countless options the Pocket Casts app offers.

Moreover, the **Car Play feature** enables you to play audio and video podcasts wherever you go. You can also download podcasts if you want to listen to them while you are offline.

### 7\. Apple Podcasts

### 8\. Spotify

### 9\. Overcast

### 10\. Castro

Managing large numbers of episodes with Castro won’t take much more than a few moments of your time. Subscribe to a podcast you like, and all of the latest episodes will land in the New tab.

The app is free for just ten days, afterward, you must upgrade to Laughable Insider if you want to have access to all the shows and episodes this podcast player has to offer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
