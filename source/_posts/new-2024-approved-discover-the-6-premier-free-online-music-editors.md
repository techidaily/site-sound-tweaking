### Conclusion

Scream sound effects are one of the most exciting effects that are used in films and shows since years. Though the Wilhelm scream sound effect is the most popular one, the woman screaming sound effect, crowd screaming sound effect, and female scream sound effect are also widely liked, and add to the overall appeal to the video in related scenes. There are multiple sources from where you can get these effects. Using Filmora, you can separate scream mp3 files from movies and shows and then use them by adding them to your own videos. Filmora makes video editing fun, smooth, fast and perfect!
