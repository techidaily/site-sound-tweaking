As the name represents, this style of Jazz is free of rules. The musicians werenâ€™t bound to anything. They had a free hand to do anything. Free Jazz was often negatively targeted and criticized.

### Â· Big Band

Big band is another type of jazz music. This is also referred to as 'Swing' jazz background music. The style began in the 1930s. It had a stronger emphasis on the rhythm part. Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Artie Shaw are among the outstanding instrumentalists of Swing bands.
