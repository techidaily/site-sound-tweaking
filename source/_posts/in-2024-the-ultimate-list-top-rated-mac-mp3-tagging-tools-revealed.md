---

## How to Add Audio in After Effects

![add audio in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-in-after-effects.jpg)

3\. Import the audio file to the project file as well (that is required to be added).

4\. Make sure to convert the audio file to .mp3 format.
