The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.</p>

<p>A straightforward answer to that can be, using YouTube Studio’s built-in video editor. But considering the limited features it has on offer, you might require something that can allow you to add premium features: drag and drop special effects, custom animation on the go, and much more.</p>
<p>So, if you are looking for such features too, then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the answer to your requirements.

<h3 id="Features-3"><a href="#Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h3><p>● Adding background music to the video: Music makes everything merry. So, if you want your video to look stunning, you know that music is the key. Hence, Filmora comes with the feature of adding background music&#x2F;sound to your video that will keep your -audience engaged and entertained throughout it-.</p>
<p>● Audio de-noise: As a content creator, it’s impossible to make sure that there is no noise distraction in the background every time you sit down to record a video. These background noises can be a huge distraction for your viewers and might even annoy them off. Therefore, Filmora has come up with the best de-noise feature to help you reduce the background noises in your video.</p>
<p>● Fade Audio in or out: Like the transition of the scenes in a video, the audio change is equally important. You cannot complete a perfect transition without a proper audio fade. Filmora offers you a more straightforward method to adjust the audio in your video during the transition.</p>
<p>● Beat Detection: Syncing a video has been a hassle for content creators over the years. Beat detection has, however, changed the game completely. In Filmora’s beat detection feature, you can analyze the music and generate beat markers to help you while syncing the audio and special effects.</p>
<p>● Adjust applied audio effects: This is another game-changing feature that helps you lengthen or shorten the length of an impact according to your video. Filmora’s Adjust Audio Effect feature allows you to delay the time of the effect and the factor of effects like echo, lobby, big room etc.</p>

One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>

<p>The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.</p>

It has some of the most useful features regards to song recognition that helps you get a complete music experience.</p>
<p>The standout feature of SoundHound is that you can have a song recognized in it by merely humming a short tune. This is very helpful when you don’t remember the lyrics of the song or the song’s title or who sang it.</p>
<p>The service is pretty quick meaning you can have songs and music identified in a matter of seconds. You will get all available details of the concerned song or tune and what more, you can also sing along to real-time lyrics in the app.</p>
<p>It also allows you to stream your playlists from other music apps like Spotify, YouTube and others. Your song search list is stored so that you don’t have to look for a song all over again if you have once searched it on SoundHound. This saves time and keeps your discovered songs organized.</p>
<p>You can use the app for The paid service of Shazam goes by the name of Shazam Encore and it costs $2.99.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shazam"><a href="#2-Shazam" class="headerlink" title="2.  Shazam"></a>2.  Shazam</h3><p>Shazam is the most popular music recognition app available out there, and its features will tell you why.

You can use Shazam offline. It records the song offline, and later when you go online, it provides all the information about that song.</p>
<p>The Pop-Up Shazam is a unique feature that helps you identify any song that is played in your smartphone. It works with any app and is especially helpful when you are surfing social media and want to know about a song or background music you just came across on it.</p>
<p>There is also an Auto Shazam feature that works like “Now Playing” on Pixel devices. This feature works in the background and gives you song info notifications as it recognizes songs in your environment. The only drawback of this feature is that it doesn’t work offline.</p>

But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
<p>The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.</p>
<p>Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.</p>

<li><strong>Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?</strong></li>
