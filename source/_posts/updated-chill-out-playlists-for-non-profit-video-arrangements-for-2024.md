## "Chill-Out Playlists for Non-Profit Video Arrangements"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.

### 2Add photos to audio and rearrange them

 Then select these added files and move them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The photos should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the music track. Then put the photos in the order you want them to appear in your creation. After that, adjust timing by highlighting and target file and moving the red slider.

 Besides that, you can also improve the quality of your photos and even apply special effects to them. To review the list of available filters and effects, click the “Effects” button in the tool bar to display the menu. Here is a detailed guide about how to apply effects to video.

 If the audio file needs editing, double click it and adjust the volume and pitch or add fade in or fade out effect in the pop up window.

### 3Share or save our own creation

 After adding photos to audio, you can save the creation in different ways. In the “Format” tab, you can save the file in any popular media format. If you want the file be played on mobile devices, go to the “Device” tab and choose one of the devices from the list.

 Of course, publish it in social media like Facebook and YouTube is also another good choice if you want to share the video with your friend. To do this, click the “Create” button and go to the “YouTube” tab. Fill in the information and this program will publish your creation to the social media pages - it will be uploaded promptly and properly. You can also burn a DVD and present your family or friends with a beautifully packaged disk.
