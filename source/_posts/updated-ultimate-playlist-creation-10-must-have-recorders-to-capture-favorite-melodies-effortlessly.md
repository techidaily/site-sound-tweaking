### 2. [Free After Effects Audio Visualizer Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/template/free-audio-visualizer-jazz-hip-hop-copyrighted-sound-for-youtube-0za2djdafqy)

6Frame is a verified creator on Velosofy, and they have put together a unique visualize that is specially designed for hip-hop, jazz, and funk music styles.

### 3. [Light Audio Spectrum](https://www.videoblocks.com/video/light-audio-spectrum-uoatksj)

This visualizer is found over at VideoBlocks, which is an easy to use website that allows you to get your hands on all sorts of templates for After Effects and other video editing software options. This particular one uses the time-honored visualization that’s similar to what you’d see on a soundboard, with continually rising and falling bars that bring you into the music. It also has some light visuals on the upper half of the animation, which can make it feel like you’re DJing!

![Light Audio Spectrum](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/light-audio-spectrum.jpg)

### 4. [Animated Audio Spectrum](https://shareae.com/after-effects-project/elements/20159-videohive-animated-audio-spectrum-music-visualizer.html)

With 15 different options, this is a unique option that you can use to bring a little bit of visualization to your next YouTube video. It has ten radial spectrums, four horizontal spectrums, and the very unique animated avatar. The avatar is similar to the other audio spectrum visualizations, but it brings a more humanoid twist to it. This is available for use in After Effects and is at a standard 1920 x 1080 resolution and a visual speed of 60 Frames Per Second (FPS).

![Animated Audio Spectrum](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/animated-audio-spectrum.jpg)

### 5. [Ultimate Audio Spectrum](https://kiwivfx.com/audio%5Ftemp/?p=444)

The Ultimate Audio Spectrum has a variety of visual appearances and audio visualizations, which makes it easy for you to find the one that you like and what you want to be able to use. It’s perfect for beginners because it has been coded in such a way that, if there’s an error, it automatically corrects without the user even seeing it. Flashes, pumps, bass effects, sliders, and even a space to put song information makes it simple for you to get things set up and then use it for any music video project.

### 6. [Round Audio Spectrum](https://www.pond5.com/after-effect/111244915/round-audio-spectrum.html)

Round audio spectrums are popular because they offer a simple way to visualize the music without taking away from it. Like many of the options on the Pond5 website, this one is built for modern versions of After Effects. It’s available in Full HD, and you don’t need anything else to add it to any project. It’s a clean, classy way to add some visuals to your next music project.

![Round Audio Spectrum](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/round-audio-spectrum.jpg)

### 7. [Music Note for Music Party](https://www.videezy.com/music-related/41236-music-note-for-music-party)

Horizontal and Round options are pretty typical for audio visuals, but this music note takes it to a whole new level. While it still uses the technology you see in round options, it has two different ones connected by stems, which makes it look like a music note. The color is entirely uniform (other than the visualization areas on the circles), which gives it a clean, seamless look that you won’t find anywhere else. This is an excellent addition to any DJ’s repertoire or if you want to do something a little different with a music video for YouTube.

![Music Note for Music Party](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/music-note-for-music-party.jpg)

### 8. [Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates](https://motionarray.com/after-effects-templates/free-audio-visualizer-ae-templates-128411)

The last of our audio spectrum options uses a horizontal “wave” system that allows you to get a look at the music that you’re listening to. With multiple color options and an easy to customize the format, you’ll find it quite entrancing when you decide to use this for any of your projects. They even suggest you use it for podcasts and other speaking videos you may be uploading to YouTube because the colors help your audience to engage.

![Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/free-audio-visualizer-ae-templates.jpg)

Whether you’re looking to download some audio spectrum files or you want a whole software option to download, video and audio spectrum tools are a lot of fun to play with. We hope that these options can help you to figure out what you need to do and which audio spectrum tools you want to use for your projects. It’s worth taking a look and seeing what you can find.
