### 7. [3D Lyrics](https://elements.envato.com/kinetic-typography-3d-lyrics-two-ae-projects-VDPC5G6)

The 3D lyrics video template is one of its kind as it contains two projects under one model.

The first version is straightforward where you get to learn the steps like

* how to edit texts
* how to add images/music/logo
* how to use controls
* how to render video in any resolution and fps

and quickly get started even by any amateur after effect user.

But, the second version is a little complicated. It is a detailed version of the first one where you learn how a project is organized and how you should customize it.

It also has tips on how to create previews during customization in the least possible time.

You need to arrange the scenes you wish to use in final composition, import the audio, and edit the first, second, and third scene’s text.

It allows you to change the background color, adjust controls like extrusion quality, etc. and ten other adjustment layers. Finally, render the video at a particular frame rate and resolution.

![add music to audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg)

Open Filmora video editor on your Windows or Mac computer, and import your audio file to the audio track in the timeline. Go to the **Titles** tab, and select your preferred title. There are plentiful title templates in Filmora video editor for different scenarios, such as gaming, social media, education & tutorial, travel, and sports. If you just want to add plain text, you can go to the Basic category or Plain Text category to add simple text without any animation.

**Step 2: Type text to build the Lyrics you want**

![customize lyric texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg)

 Double click the title in the timeline and then click the **Advanced** button to go to the Advanced Text Edit window. From there, you can write your lyrics, add a text box, change colors and font, and add animations to the lyrics.

**Step 3: Add Transitions to Lyric Text**

![add transitions to lyric texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg)

Go to the **Transitions** tab and select the desired transition. For example, you can search warp on the search bar, and it will list many wrap effects. You can choose one wrap transition effect first and then double click the transition to set its duration and position.

**Step 4: Add Effects to a lyric video**

To make the lyric video more vivid, we can add some special effects to the lyric frames. Filmora provides lots of visual effects in the Effects tab, including trending effects, and effects for different scenarios. Like the video below, it uses Extreme effects. What’s more, you can customize the parameters of the effect to fine-tune the result.
