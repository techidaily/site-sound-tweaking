![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Autochords.jpg)

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
