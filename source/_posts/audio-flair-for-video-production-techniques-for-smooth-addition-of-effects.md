Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.

* [**Part 1: Best iOS DAW for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best iOS DAW for iPhone**](#part2)

## Part 1：Best iOS DAW for iPad

Without further ado, let’s start with the best iOS DAWs for iPads.

### 1\. [GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad)

**Price:** Free with optional pay-to-add features

[GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad) is a high-quality DAW that allows you to use the Audio Unit (AU) standard. You can edit, enhance, distort, add an echo, and even a reverb, all through this one platform. GarageBand is the best iOS DAW for iPad if you happen to be a beginner. It does lack some of the finesse of the more significant, more professional systems.

**Features:**

* Apple sound and loop library is packed with choice and easily accessible.
* Can use it to download plugins from other people.
* Easy to follow for beginners, lets you edit 24-bit recordings.

![GarageBand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/garageband-phone.JPG)

### 2\. [Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519)

**Price**: $23.99

[Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519) is an app by Stienberg which features multiple sound sequencing and some other cool features. It comes in Cubasis, Cubasis Le (the compact version), and the updated Cubasis 2 and 3\. This is considered the best iOS DAW for iPad because it is designed to be quick and easy to use.

**Features:**

* You can use it as a multitrack recorder with hardware like RME’s FireFace UCX.
* Newest version works with both iPad and iPhone.
* Full mixer with level meters, zooms, multi-layer audio, and rearrangeable inserts.

![Cubasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/cubasis-phone.JPG)

### 3\. [FL Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619)

**Price:** $13.99

[FL Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619) is filled with heavy synths like Sakura and Harmless. It’s also able to compress, features a ton of presets, and comes with a step sequencer that can allow any sound samples to be added to, or kick-started by, the sequencer. It applies numerous optional plugins and VSTs, which make it ideal for beginners. They specialize in making it all fairly easy to understand, even for new users.

**Features:**

* Step sequenced that can be used as a sort of music-placement grid to track the beat.
* Full to the brim with native plugins that help you make the most of the system.
* It comes with loads of synth bundles and preset options to help you in terms of speed.

![FL Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fl-studio-mobile.JPG)

### 4\. [Auxy Pro – Music & Beat Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-pro-music-beat-maker/id1034348186#?platform=ipad)

**Price:** Free with in-app purchases

[Auxy Pro – Music & Beat Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-pro-music-beat-maker/id1034348186#?platform=ipad) is one of the best DAWs for iPad because it is similar to a musical sketchbook, if you like. While artists can sketch ideas out, musicians have a much harder time noting down tunes. Auxy Pro is good for the busy artist that wants to sketch out songs to develop when they have more time.

**Features:**

* Massive sound library with constant new content being added.
* Loop mixing and the ability to import sampled instruments.
* Individual controls and settings for each downloadable sound or sample.

![Auxy Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/auxy-pro-phone.JPG)

**Price:** Free! (upgrades and in-app purchasing)

[Korg Gadget 2 Le](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/korg-gadget-2-le/id1092332319#?platform=ipad) is the best DAW for iPad for those that like accessories. There are plugins aplenty for this platform, where beats are organized by genre, and each one is customizable.

* Uses simple instruments grouped together for specific functions (gadgets) with hundreds of controls each for maximum individuality.

![KORG Gadget 2 Le](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/korg-gadget-2-l2-phone.JPG)

As well as DAWs for iPads, we also looked at the best iOS DAWs for iPhones, too.

Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.

* [**Part 1: Best iOS DAW for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best iOS DAW for iPhone**](#part2)

## Part 1：Best iOS DAW for iPad

Without further ado, let’s start with the best iOS DAWs for iPads.

### 1\. [GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad)

You can edit, enhance, distort, add an echo, and even a reverb, all through this one platform. GarageBand is the best iOS DAW for iPad if you happen to be a beginner. It does lack some of the finesse of the more significant, more professional systems.

**Features:**

* Apple sound and loop library is packed with choice and easily accessible.

* Easy to follow for beginners, lets you edit 24-bit recordings.
