                ></p>
<p>There is a great way to make your messages more impactful that is free to use. Pexels is an online creative assets library that features high-resolution photos, including Pexels 4k, and an assortment of audio clips you can use in your creations.</p>
<p>The following are things you need to know about Pexels.com. It includes details on what Pexels is, important user information, and other hidden features of the website. Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<h2 id="Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use"><a href="#Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?"></a>Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?</h2><p>Yes, Pexels.com is a free online library of stock photos that you can use for personal or commercial purposes with your creations. In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.</p>
<p>Pexels’ free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.</p>
<p>According to the site’s founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.</li>
<li>You can also donate to the website’s operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.</li>
<li>Most of the site’s contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p>
<p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.</p>
<p>Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device. In addition, you can also access the asset library through the Canva application following their merger. Furthermore, you can also download it as a plugin for different content creation software, including Photoshop, MS Office, and Google Slides.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Pexels free download leaderboard is a list of the site’s top contributors within the past thirty days. The ranking is based on the number of views of photos and videos you submit within thirty days.

In addition, the situation becomes worse if your ideology contains offensive material and messaging.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Pexels license also bans using their creative assets to promote your personal brand, especially when they contain any identifiable imagery. By doing so, Pexels.com remains a free resource for people of all creeds, regardless of their political affiliations.</p>
