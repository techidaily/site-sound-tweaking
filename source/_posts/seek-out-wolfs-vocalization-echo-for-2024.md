But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

Step1 Install the Spotify app on your PC or Mac.

Step2 Open the Spotify app and login to your account.

Step3 Locate the Podcast show you wish to download.

![locate the podcast show](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/download-podcast-from-spotify-to-computer.jpg)

Step4 Move your cursor over the Podcast episodes and click the download button to download them to your computer.

The backward of using Podcast manager apps is that it can only save your Podcast in the manager app. If you uninstall the app accidentally, you lose access to the saved Podcast because it won't be available on your PC.

To cope with this problem, we provide third-party apps to directly download the Podcast to your computer from the manager apps.

## Method 2- Download Podcasts From Popular Podcast Manager Apps Using Third-Party Tools

To download Podcasts in unprotected formats from Spotify, you need a third-party tool to alter Spotify .ogg audio. The most helpful and commonly used tool is TuneFab Spotify Music Converter. It is free for 30 days, and you can purchase it after discovering it is compatible with you!

It will convert Podcasts and as well as download songs, audiobooks, and playlists into MP3, WAV, FLAC, and M4V. Follow the below instructions to get your hands on it!

Step1 First, download [TuneFab Spotify Music Converter](https://www.tunefab.com/sp-music-converter/), then follow the outlines on the screen to get set up on your computer. Then launch this tool to start the conversion process.

Step2 Now, log in to your Spotify account in this tool to easily access your download list.

Step3 After that, find out the required Podcast and click on the **"Add"** button in front of the Podcast. You can also directly drag and drop the file into the "Add" button.

Step4 You can now get the download and convert option adjacent to every Podcast episode. You must check the file format and click on the available option to continue the process.

You can also change the output location of the Podcast on a PC, where you'll find out easily.

![formats to convert podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/download-podcasts-to-computers-2.jpg)
