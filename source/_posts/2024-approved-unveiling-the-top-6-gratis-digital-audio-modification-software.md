## Part 1\. A Quick Verdict of Sound Forge

Sound Forge is one of the best software for professionals, beginners, and enthusiasts due to its simple and essential restoration tools that can help remove unnecessary background noises.

You can record and extract audio from video files. The customizable toolbars, interfaces, and a wide variety of presets give you a complete audio editing experience with Sound Forge.

The only drawback is that the software cannot handle multiple audio files and plugin effects together in the free version, making it useless for batch processing. However, you can get these features in the paid version.

![sound forge vs audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sound-forge-vs-audacity.jpg)

### What is Audacity?

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is free and open-source software developed by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg and released on May 28, 2000\. In April 2021, Muse group acquired the Audacity trademark but kept the application free and open source.

Audacity offers a great variety of features, such as a playback/record tool, editing options, and a wide range of effects that help professionals to adjust soundtracks, import and export audio files in any standard format, and analyze sound frequencies.

### Our Recommendations

Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

Most companies (with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M revenue) and the higher education industry in the United States are using Sound Forge.

On the other hand, businesses often use Audacity for marketing purposes, such as making Podcasts. The software can record audio for PowerPoint presentations to help visually impaired employees.

![sound forge vst feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sound-forge-vst-feature.jpg)

### Cons of Sound Forge

* **No Batch Processing:** one main drawback of Sound Forge is that it cannot do batch processing, making it useless to process multiple audio files and plug-ins together.
* **Noise reduction/ Noise cancellation:** The software does not do much for noise reduction; its "Noise Gate Technology" distort the recording instead of filtering the noise.

## Ideas to Create a Funny Comedy Video or Vlog

Are you a funny person and want to create videos for your YouTube channel? If yes, then here are some ideas that you can try:

### 1\. Create a Comedy Skit

Many popular YouTube content creators create comedy skits to entertain their audience. These videos include humorous content and funny dialogues. To create a comedy skit you should have a center of the story, dialogues, characters, and comedy background music.

The major time that you will spend is gathering the ideas and creating a script. This requires brainstorming and at least one funny guy in your team. For inspiration, you can notice people around you and use them as inspiration.

### 2\. Things You Can Do with Everyday Household Items

Not specifically the eggs, but videos where people use regular items in unusual ways are sometimes funny. These videos will look funny when you include comedy background music. Some ideas of these types of videos are using eggs for various tasks other than cooking.

While creating these videos you can add funny elements like fixing a tile with the egg. These types of content are random, so it makes people laugh. And don’t forget comedy background music plays an essential role to make these videos funny.

### 3\. Visit a Park with Your Dog

Dogs are funny, especially when you take them to the place they like. When you will take your dog to the park and make vlogs about the journey, people will love it. While making vlogs you can record some exciting actions performed by your dog and upload them online. If you are thinking about how these clips will make your audience laugh, then the answer is simple, comedy background music.

### 4\. Make Reaction Videos

Reaction videos that you might have seen might not be funny. But, some content creators make funny reaction videos. They react to funny videos and use comedy background music to make the content engaging.

### 5\. Film a Prank

Prank videos are the most popular comedy videos on YouTube. In these videos, one or more people prank another person while the audience watching the video already knows. Many people who are fond of prank videos love the final reactions. If you want to create prank videos, you can add comedy background music for more fun.
