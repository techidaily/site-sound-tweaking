Don't you just hate the sound of your own voice? As much as most of us have perfectly pleasant voices, regardless of how they sound when we hear them played back, sometimes we just don't have a good quality voice for video making.

Some people try to get around this by relying on the written word. While that's OK in some situations, it's just not as engaging as a high-quality voiceover. So, what can you do?

Many video makers have found great success in altering their voice ever so slightly. If they have a tendency to garble, slowing things down can help them get their point across better. Similarly, if they have a somewhat squeaky voice, adjusting the tone down a couple of notches can make them appear more authoritative.

Good video editing tools will allow you to play with the speed and pitch of your audio recordings, and not just voices either. Perhaps you want to jazz up a piece of music by playing it faster or add a playful element to your video by cranking the pitch of the music up to chipmunk levels.

Whatever you have in mind, being able to edit the speed and tone of audio in our videos opens up a world of possibilities for voiceover, music and more.

## Adjusting speed and pitch in Adobe Rush

We were excited to see what Adobe had in store for us as soon as they started talking about Rush. Branded a tool for the social media generation, it promised incredible usability, effortless integration with a variety of platforms and all the wonderful editing powers that Adobe are renowned for.

However, there have been more than a few oversights in what Adobe actually produced.

Users have complained that its slow, that rendering takes too long and that the software can be unstable. Worse than that, it seems that a number of key features are missing, such as being able to adjust the speed of video and to change the pitch and speed of audio too.

In short, if you're looking for a way to edit audio to be slower or faster, higher or lower in Adobe Rush, you simply can't. However, there is an alternative.

From the team at Wondershare comes a package known as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); an all in one video editing suite designed to do everything you need, and more. Within the capabilities of this software is the ability to edit your audio's pitch and speed, so that you can create the perfect auditory accompaniment to your movies and videos.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to edit audio in Filmora

Using the tools built into Filmora, you can change the pitch and speed of audio in just a few clicks. The function works on all imported audio, whether its attached to the video, recorded separately or is music that you've added to your library.

We'll talk you thorough how to use these editing tools, so that you know you've got an alternative to Adobe Rush.

The easiest way to edit the pitch of the audio in Filmora is to use the edit button on the control panel. Highlight the clip you want to edit, then use the button which features three lines with sliders.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audio-panel-in-filmora9.png)

Clicking this button will open up the edit menu, which allows you to edit video, audio, color and motion. Within the audio edit, you can fade the soundtrack in and out, can alter the pitch and can adjust the volume and equalizer settings too.

Within this menu, a handy tool will allow you to 'remove background noise' also. You can also set audio to fade in or out and can adjust the equalizer to suit the type of audio you're working with.

To change the speed of the audio along with the pictures, you can use the speedometer button above your track. You can also right click the clip and choose 'Speed and duration', or even use the shortcut ctrl+R to open the speed change menu directly.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-audio-speed-filmora9.png)

If you wish to change the speed of the audio without changing the video at all, you'll need to detach the audio from the video clip. This is simple; just right click the clip in question and select 'Detach Audio'. You can now edit the audio independently of the video.

Of course, if you're working on audio which is standalone, e.g. a voiceover or some music you want to play with your video, there's no requirement to detach it from any video clip.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll also discover the Audio Mixer, in the button with the musical notes on it. Clicking on this brings up an advanced audio adjuster, which can help you create a better audio quality for your video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-mixer-filmora9.png)

This allows you to adjust the specific settings of the videos you've uploaded, as well as any additional audio tracks you've added to your project. You can work in stereo or surround sound and can control the direction of all the audio within the mixer.

Wondershare Filmora has managed to not only provide a service Adobe has not, they've made it super easy too. Why don't you try out the free version of Filmora for yourself and see why we recommend this for all your video editing needs.

## Step-by-Step to Free Digital Sound Logging: The Audacity Way

Natural audio recording software, such as Voice Memos for Macs or Sound Recorder for Windows PCs, is included with every machine. These applications enable users to record audio using either the desktop's internal or an external microphone, and they generally have basic audio editing features.

However, when you're looking for a higher-quality recording program, Audacity is the way to go. Audacity is a [free audio editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with a lot of cutting-edge features. More significantly, recording using Audacity is as simple as clicking a button.

In this **Audacity Record Computer Audio** guide, we will show you all the methods of recording internal audio on your computer and Mac.

#### In this article

01 [Record Audio On Audacity with a Microphone](#part1)

02 [Record Sounds Playing on Your Computer Using Audacity on Win](#part2)

03 [Record Sounds Playing on Your Computer Using Audacity on Mac](#part3)

04 [Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Record Audio On Audacity with a Microphone On Windows and Mac Computers?

For both Windows and Mac, the procedures for recording audio from a microphone are the same if you're utilizing your desktop's built-in mic or an external microphone. Here's your step-by-step guide to audacity record using a microphone:

**Step 1:** Launch **Audacity** and get to know the **Device Toolbar**, situated underneath the playback controls. You may modify the **Audio Host** and the **Recording** and **Playback Devices**—all of which are required for Audacity recording.

![audacity interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-interface.jpg)

**Step 2:** To begin, select **Tracks** under the **Add New** tab, **Stereo Track**, or **Mono Track** to create a new track.

![audacity add new track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-track-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Select **Recording Device** from the options list. Select your microphone from the dropdown menu and hit the **Record** option.

![audacity record audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-audio-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** A soundwave emerges along the track as you talk into the speaker. The **Recording Level** may be found at the top of the display. To pause or stop the recording, click **Stop** or **Pause** until you select **Record** anew.

![audacity recorded audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recorded-audio-waveform-audacity.jpg)

**Step 5:** With the mouse over any recording area, click the **Delete** button to cut out any portion of it quickly. Click **Ctrl + A**, then **Delete** to erase whatever you've just saved. Alternatively, press the **X** button to delete the track completely.

## Part 2: How to Record Sounds Playing on Your Computer Using Audacity On Windows?

Unlike Mac, Windows makes it simple to capture audio from a movie or media file running on your desktop. There seem to be two primary methods for accomplishing audacity record desktop audio in this way:

**1\. Use MME as the Audio Host**

**Step 1:** To use MME as your audio host, go to **Tracks** in the **Add New** tab in **Stereo Track** and create a new file.

![record playing sound with audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-playing-computer-sound-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** Change the **Audio Host** (to the left of **Recording Device**) to **MME**—this is the standard setting, so you might not have to change anything.

![change audio host in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-audio-host-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose desired option from the **Recording Device** dropdown menu. Based on your configuration, this might be referred to as **Wave Out** or **Loopback**. When you're uncertain, try it out.

![choose audio recording device in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-recording-device-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** To record your audio source, click **Record**, then play it back.

**2\. Use WASAPI as the Audio Host**

WASAPI provides higher-resolution digital recordings. If capturing audio from an external monitor, it's also a good idea to utilize it.

**Step 1:** Convert the **Audio Host** from **MME** to **Windows WASAPI** after creating a fresh **Stereo Track**.

![  audacity change host ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-use-windows-wasapi-host.jpg)

**Step 2:** Switch the **Recording Device** to **Speaker (loopback).** To display the entire label, you might have to slide the toolbar's knobs outwards. Begin recording by pressing the **red dot** and then listen to the audio source. **Audacity** will capture the audio even if your PC is muted.

## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?
