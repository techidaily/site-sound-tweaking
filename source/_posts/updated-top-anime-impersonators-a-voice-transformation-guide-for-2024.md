Even though the TwistedWave Online Audio Editor can be used free of charge, you **must create an account in order to save the files you create**. And the free plan has limited features in file length and audio editing features. The online audio editor enables you to **record new audio files or to edit the existing ones**. Audio clips **can be imported from your computer, the Soundcloud platform or Google Drive.** After you upload a file to the TwistedWave, the editor window will display the file on its timeline as a waveform. Clicking on the **Effects** menu and selecting the **Reverse** option will play the file you uploaded backwards. Selecting the **Download** option in the File menu will give you the access to the **Audio Export** window where you can adjust the file’s properties before saving it to your computer.

## Best Audio Editing Software to Reverse Audio

At the moment there a lot of free audio editing software options available on the market which are powerful enough to enable you to reverse all sorts of audio files. We recommend using the [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) software to reverse your audio files. This **free, open source and cross-platform** software had 62.5 million downloads as of September 2018, which speaks volumes about its audio editing potential.

The software is **compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems**, and it offers a quick and easy way to **reverse an audio file**. After you’ve installed and launched the software, you just have to import the file, by selecting the Audio option, from the Import submenu that can be accessed from the software’s File menu. Alternatively, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+I keyboard shortcut to select the file you’d like to import into the software.

The file will be displayed as a waveform and placed on the software’s timeline. You can then proceed to **select the portion of the file you’d like to reverse** by holding the left mouse button while dragging the mouse cursor between any two points within the file. Use the Ctrl+A shortcut to select the entire file or head over to the Edit menu, click on the Select option and **choose All** from the submenu.

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-reverse-audio.jpg)

Once you’ve made sure that you properly selected the portion of the file you’d like to reverse, you should go to the **Effects** menu and click on the **Reverse** feature. The software will reverse the highlighted portion of the file and you can listen to the results by clicking on the Play button. The **Export Audio** option that is available in the File menu lets you save the reversed audio to a chosen destination on your hard drive.

## Best Audio Reverser Apps for iOS and Android

Listening to reversed versions of your favorite songs on your Smartphone can be a lot of fun, so if you would like to explore the possibilities of reversing audio directly from an iPhone or Android device you should check out these apps.

#### 1. [Reverse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.audio.reverse.music.audio.player&hl=en%5FUS)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-music-player-android-audio-reverser.jpg)

The Reverse Music Player is an Android-based app that lets you reverse sounds or music with ease. What’s more, you can make a song’s tempo up to 4 times faster or slower or adjust its Pitch. The app supports wav, mp3, ogg and flac audio file formats, but if you are using a large audio file reversing a song may take some time. A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.

#### 2. [Reverse Audio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reverse-audio/id1254981556?mt=8)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-audio-ios-audio-reverser.jpg)

iPhone users can reverse audio files they record with this app in just a few simple steps. The app lets you record an audio file and then it automatically plays the recording backwards. While you’re playing the audio, you can alter the Playback Rate or the Pitch. The Reverse Audio app also enables you to import audio files from other apps via the Share option, but audio files cannot be directly imported into the app. The limited amount of audio editing options makes this iOS-based app a moderately reliable choice for reversing audio files.

**Conclusion**

Playing songs or audio effects backwards can have unexpected results, which makes the process of reversing audio incredibly entertaining. These free and easy to use audio reversers can help you create high-quality sound effects that might make the videos you used them for, go viral. What is your favorite method of reversing audio files? Leave a comment below and let us know.
