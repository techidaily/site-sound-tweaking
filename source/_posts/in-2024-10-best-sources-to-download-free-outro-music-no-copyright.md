* Fast Processing Ability: Unlike other video editors that take ages to process the videos after editing, Filmora is super-fast. It renders the videos quickly, and also shows a preview of the project before you finalize your video.
* Supports Various File Formats: Filmora supports a wide range of file formats, including MP3, MP4, WMV, AVI, MKV, F4V, GIF, MPEG-2 and WEBM amongst others, preventing you from the headache of converting your videos into supportable formats.
* Split Screen Functionality: This is a highly useful feature that comes in handy when you have multiple videos on your hands that you can play at the same time. You just need to select the split-screen icon on the home menu, and select as many numbers of screens you want, and in any particular order you need.
* Audio Separation: This is one of the key features of Filmora that makes it stand out from its competitors. As the name suggests, this feature lets you separate any audio clip from a video, and then save it as a file that can further be added to another video.
* Social Import: Filmora understands the modern trends, and provides options to directly import videos from social media channels, edit it, add sound effects and then upload it back to social media within no time.
