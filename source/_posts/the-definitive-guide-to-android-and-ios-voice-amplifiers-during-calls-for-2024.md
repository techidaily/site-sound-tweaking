#### 1 Add your MKV files to the program

Install and run Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and click the “Import” button to locate and add your target MKV files. Then the imported files will be displayed in the media library as the picture shown below.

#### 2 Remove audio from MKV

After that, drag and drop the videos from the media library to the Timeline. Right click the video clip you want to remove audio and choose “Detach Audio” to separate audio from MKV. Then you will see video and audio displayed in different tracks, press the “Delete” button on your keyboard or right click the track and select the "Delete" command to remove the unwanted audio track from MKV.

Tip: If want to add a new sound track or background music to your video, just import it to the media library and then drag and drop to the proper position of the Timeline. Here is a detailed guide on how to add background music to video.

#### 3 Preview and save the new file

Preview the new file by clicking the Play icon to see if it’s what you want. If you are happy with the result, hit “Create” to export the edited MKV file. As you see, you can select a desired output method: save the video in various formats, save it to play on portable devices, burn it to DVD disc or share it to YouTube directly. Then click “Create”, and your new file will be saved in a few seconds
