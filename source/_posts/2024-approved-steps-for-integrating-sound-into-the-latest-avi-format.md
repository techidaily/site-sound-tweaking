_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

## Expert Platforms for Silencing Background Noise in Audio Files

In most cases, the most typical request you'll get from video makers is to eliminate the unpleasant noises like rumble or hum from the completed piece of video. When filming, it's tough to get good audio since the dialogue is often muffled by ambient noise, such as the dreaded whir of an air conditioning unit or fans. When combining and filming sound effects or other design aspects for the video, background noise is often removed.

Fortunately, there are a few approaches that you can take to **remove** **noise** **from audio Online**. You can denoise your video or audio by adding some background music or using audio or video editing software to reduce noise. If you're looking for a technique to get rid of background noise, this article will serve you well in your quest. Let's get started!

02 [How to Remove Background Noise Online](#part2)

03 [Tips For Removing Background Noise From Audio BEFORE You Record](#part3)

04 [FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online](#part4)

## Part 1: What Is Audio Noise And Why Is It Harmful?

No definition exists for audio noise; however, it is often defined as background noises such as fans, people chatting, automobiles or trucks going by, buzzing from broken audio wiring, or other ambient sounds that should not be included in your film. Your viewers will be distracted from the crucial information provided by the individual speaking in your video if the audio is too noisy.

Compared to that, noisy audios tend to damage the experience you're looking for. Consider this: if you're listening to a voice recording of your manager at work and it's noisy to a point, you're unable to make sense of it, you would most probably end up missing out on crucial details.

When it comes to creating a decent video, clear audio goes a long way. But that's not all there is to it.

## Part 3: Tips For Removing Background Noise From Audio BEFORE You Record

We all want to get rid of the noisy background from our audio. Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:

**Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places**

The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.

A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.

After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?

Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.

**Tip 2: Record A Test**

After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.

Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.

**Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording**

After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating/cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.

Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.

Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.

## Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online

**1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio**

Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it's after you've done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.

These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!

**2\. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?**

Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.

Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.

We all want to get rid of the noisy background from our audio. Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:

**Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places**

The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.

A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.

After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?

Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.

**Tip 2: Record A Test**

After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.

Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.

**Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording**

After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating/cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.

Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.

Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.
