#### 2\. Merge Video and Audio

After importing your videos to the media library, you can drag-n-drop the video and audio files to the video and audio track respectively. After that, you can align the video with the audio file on the timeline to merge them. Or if you want to replace the audio in the source video with the new audio file, you can right click the video on the track, select Detach Audio, and the original audio from the video will be detached out to the audio track. Then you can delete the detached audio from the track, add your new audio file to the audio track again, and finally align it with the video.

It’s been some time since people have been receiving information in the form of audio files. From college lectures and audible notes to project meetings, interviews, etc. a large amount of information is being shared through audios. But audio files make it hard to access the information whenever you choose as it can be buried in hours of recordings.

So there is a need to convert these audios into texts. Texts are easy to access and it is also possible to selectively choose the information you need whenever you need it.

But you might be worrying about how to convert hours of recordings to texts. Don’t worry, due to the advancement of technology, there are now a lot of applications available to us that can **transcribe audio to text** free.

## How to Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android and iOS

Most people receive or record audio files on their mobile phones. From students to businessmen, the mobile phone is like a central hub that sends, receives, and stores information, including large audio files. So let’s have a look at how to convert audio to text on both android and iOS devices.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### #Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android

To convert audio to text on an android device, one of the best options is to use the [Speechnotes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en&gl=US) application. Speechnotes is a free app that offers unlimited dictation and is suitable for all kinds of people including thinkers, bloggers, joggers, etc.

This application packs in a variety of features like a backup to google drive, nonstop recording, incorporation of google speech recognition for accuracy, offline support, etc. let’s see how to transcribe audio to text using this app:

**Step 1:** Open Playstore and download the Speechnotes application.

![download speechnote](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-download-speechnote.jpg)

**Step 2:** Open Speechnotes and allow access to your microphone, storage, etc.

### #Convert Audio to Text Free on iOS

This application will allow you to dictate, translate and transcribe any texts instead of typing them. All most of all texting applications can be configured to operate with dictation which can be a big saver for you during your busy times.

Some of the features of dictation include 40 dictation and translation languages, audio recording, conversion of recorded files, synchronization with iCloud, easy sharing, etc.

Let’s have a look at how to transcribe audio to text using the Dictation app:

![transcribe audio to text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-transcribe-audio-to-text.jpg)

In this busy world where everything is happening fast, it is very important to keep up. Nowadays, everyone in different instances tends to share information in the form of voice messages. Be it long lectures, product information, briefings, etc. voice recordings are shared very much across the world.

But it is difficult to retrieve information from long audio and hence there is a need to convert audio to text. It is much easier to access information if it's available in text form rather than audio form. It also enables us to selectively access and marks the needed information. Applications like Speechnotes and dictation allow us to record and convert audio to texts. These applications help us to save time for typing as well as in accessing the information later. So if you are having a problem dealing with audio and need to convert audio to text, check out the apps we have suggested above. Thank you.

## Fading Audio in Adobe Rush

[Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) app that was released a short while ago doesn't seem to be living up to the high standard we can commonly expect from Adobe's products. The app doesn't feature fade in/out options and its audio editing capabilities are limited. The only way you can fade audio with Adobe Rush is to open the project in Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but in order to be able to do so, you have to be subscribed to the Adobe's Creative Cloud.

Wondershare[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), on the other hand, offers all tools you're going to need to produce a YouTube video including the fade in and fade out audio effects at a more affordable price. Here's how you can fade audio in Filmora.

## Fading Audio in Wondershare Filmora

#### 1\. Import video and audio files into Filmora

Most video clips contain an audio track, but in some cases, you might want to remove the clip's original audio and replace it with music, narration, dialogue or atmospheric sounds you choose. You can import an audio file into Filmora by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and selecting the Import Media Files option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-track.JPG)

#### 2\. Fading audio in Filmora

**Method 1: With Audio panel**

Clicking on the Edit button, located at the end of the software's toolbar will grant you the access to the software's audio panel where you can easily adjust the volume of the clip, select one of Equalizer presets or change the Pitch of the audio file.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-panel.JPG)

Fade in and Fade out sliders are located at the top of the Audio panel and you can drag the handle on the slider or you can insert new Fade in or Fade out values manually in the boxes next to the sliders. You can click play and decide if you like the effect you created before you click OK to confirm the changes.

**Method 2: Directly from Timeline**

In case you want to fade an audio quickly you can do so directly from the timeline. Just click on the handle at the beginning or the end of the audio file and then drag it to adjust the duration of the effect. Both of Fade in or Fade out handles can be easily moved directly on the timeline, even if you set their values from the Audio Panel.

Filmora features a lot of sound effects, like the Phone Ring, Explosion or Car Horn that can be combined with the Fade in or Fade out effect to create a better soundtrack for your video. When ready, click on the Export button and proceed to choose the video's resolution, file format or export destination. The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.

#### Conclusion

Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly.

The importance of music and atmospheric sounds is often underrated in social media videos. A good soundtrack can drastically increase the overall quality of a video since barely audible dialogues or background noises distract a viewer. Even adding simple effects like fade in or fade out can make a huge difference in how well a video is accepted by your friends on social media.
