## "Leaderboard: The Four Premier Music Editors Tailored to macOS "

A good music editor for your Mac can do everything you need: record voiceover files, cut, delete, insert audio clips, add voice effects, add sound effects, perform a spectrographic analysis, and much more. And why do you need to do those things with a music editor? Some of the most common music editor projects include:

* Find music online and edit to share to phone and other devices
* Trim audio and music files
* Create custom ringtones
* Create and share custom music and audio files
* Add music and sound effects to video files

So how do you choose a music editor for Mac that can do everything you want? In this article, we will share with you some music editors that you can use on Mac computer. Let's move on.

## Section 1\. Free Music Editors for Mac

Free-to-use is great, especially when you get all the performance and features you need in a music editor. Two free music and audio editors for Mac we recommend are:

### 1\. Audio Editor: [OcenAudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/)

**OcenAudio** has a very extensive toolkit of audio editing capabilities and tools. Still, one of its best features is that it's easy on your memory: you can edit even very large files without requiring external memory resources.

OcenAudio supports MP3, WAV, FLAC, WMA, and many other audio formats.

![ocenaudio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ocenaudio.jpg)

### 2\. MP3 Editor: [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)

**Audacity** is free and also has to go for it, a simple and intuitive interface that is easy for beginners. It also has a surprisingly extensive list of features, options, and effects, including spectrographic analysis, undo/redo function, and more.

Audacity supports many formats, including WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP2, MP3, and OGG.

![Audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity.jpg)

## Section 2\. Professional Quality Music Editors for Mac

Pay music editing programs for Mac offer a serious boost in performance and an increased number of supported formats and output options.

Two pay music and audio editors for Mac we recommend are:

### 3\. Music Editor: Wondershare Filmora Video & Audio Editor for Mac \[Free\]

[Wondershare Filmora Video & Audio Editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is often aimed at users who want to edit videos, but this program also offers professional quality performance for editing music and audio. Novice users will appreciate the price and the intuitive interface that allows a gentle learning curve.

Advanced users will like the extensive features and supported formats, including a music library feature. It has slightly fewer features and supported formats than Adobe Audition, but if you don't need those extra bells and whistles, this is the music editor for Mac for you.

### 4\. Sound Editor: [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

**Adobe Audition** comes with a high price at $20/mo. However, users who demand the best will find the cost worth it for a license. It has the most extensive audio and music editing toolset, and it supports the widest range of formats.

A complete range of tutorials also supports adobe Audition to help you get the most from your investment. The fact it takes a while to work through the tutorials and get up to speed might be the only drawback.

## Section 3\. How to choose Music Editor for Mac users?

Choosing a music editor for Mac, including the ability to edit and output to MP3 and MP4 formats, depends entirely on your needs. If your needs are modest and limited features or functionality work for you, several free-to-use options will get the job done. If you need more robust functionality and professional quality, a pay program will offer more satisfying performance. Keep in mind the following questions when making your choice:

* How often do I need to edit music and audio?
* Do I need simple trim and edit features, or also audio effects?
* What formats are my source files, and what formats do I want to output to?
* What is my budget, and how can I balance performance and price?

## Section 3\. How to choose Music Editor for Mac users?

Choosing a music editor for Mac, including the ability to edit and output to MP3 and MP4 formats, depends entirely on your needs. If your needs are modest and limited features or functionality work for you, several free-to-use options will get the job done. If you need more robust functionality and professional quality, a pay program will offer more satisfying performance. Keep in mind the following questions when making your choice:

* How often do I need to edit music and audio?
* Do I need simple trim and edit features, or also audio effects?
* What formats are my source files, and what formats do I want to output to?
* What is my budget, and how can I balance performance and price?

With Filmora, you can edit music and audio files with ease. Besides basic cutting features, you can apply fade-in and fade-out effects, adjust the audio volume. What's more, you can remove the background noise in the audio to get a clear sound.
