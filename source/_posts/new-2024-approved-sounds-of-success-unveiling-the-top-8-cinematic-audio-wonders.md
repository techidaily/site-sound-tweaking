 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

You have a video that includes a great soundtrack that you'd like to **extract** it so that you can listen to it using the media player - a portable MP3 player, for instance.

Just follow this guide to **extract audio from video** with ease.

**_If you didn't have Filmora yet, click the download button below to get started._**

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import video files

Install and run this Wondershare Filmora. Then click the “Import” button to locate and add your target video. You can also directly drag and drop the video to the program. The loaded video will be listed in the media library as the following picture shows.

#### 2. Start extracting audio from video

![extract audio from video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

After importing video to Wondershare Filmora, drag the video from the media library to the video Timeline. You can then right-click the video clip and choose “Audio Detach” to extract audio from the video. After a while, video and audio will be displayed on different tracks. If you don’t want to keep the video file, right-click it and choose “Delete” to remove it from the video timeline.

#### 3. Edit the extracted audio if you like

Double click the extracted file in the audio track and then you will see the audio editing panel.

You can add fade-in and fade-out effects, [change the sound volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjust the pitch to [change the voice](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), etc. as you like.

![edit extracted audio from video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)
