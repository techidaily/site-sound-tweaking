Want a program that can change audio volume so that it won’t be too loud or too quiet? Though many media players or speakers have volume control during playback, it still can be an annoying problem and it takes time to set it. And some downloaded files are rather low to listen to even you raise the volume to the maximum level on the computer. So it's advisable to **normalize the volume** permanently.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesn’t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer.
