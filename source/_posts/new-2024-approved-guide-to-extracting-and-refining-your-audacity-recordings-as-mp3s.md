The audio track of a video clip or movie may be edited with the Filmora video editor. Disable audio for a video, enhance audio quality, switch audio codecs, and whatever function you pick produces excellent results.

Its versatility with practically all devices, whether smartphone or computer, makes it even more appealing and one of the most powerful tools for video editing. And, unlike many video editors, Filmora includes a free entry-level Windows program that does everything you need.
