<h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Other than the seamless connectivity of AirPods with Apple products, it offers one of the most excellent perks, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). It helps you when you want to focus on anything and want to tune yourself to get yourself out of this world, and then this product can cancel a big amount of noise around you which you can keep ON and OFF according to your need.</p>
<p>All audio control will still work with windows, and it’s not compulsory to have an Apple device at another end. For example, clicking on the AirPod will pause and play the music, clicking 2 or 3 times forward and backward, and holding AirPods can switch On and Off the ANC mode.</p>
<p>Audio quality is also a big perk while using AirPods with a PC. The regular AirPods are okay in terms of music experience, but there are 5 stars for AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Battery life is also an advantage if you are an AirPod user. The battery life of AirPods is good and can last longer when you connect AirPods to PC.</p>
<p>Besides all these perks, people also like the Build and Look of AirPods. Everyone used to talk about it when they were newly launched. Now AirPods are common and also is a “status symbol,” it’s true, and that’s worth it.</p>
<h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>With windows, you can use only the basic features of AirPods. AirPods will not work to their full potential, and there are also more features that AirPods offers.</p>
<p>Price is a big disadvantage because you can get Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds and Google’s Pixel Buds. Both have some perk’s that you can not get with AirPods. Some also give preference to them look wise also. And also touch control are also better in Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft’s Surface EarBuds.</p>
<p>Wearing AirPods and keeping them in ear’s while working or jogging is tricky. AirPods fall off easily. But on the other hand, Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft’s Surface EarBuds are easy to handle and comfortable to wear compared to AirPods.</p>
<p>AirPods are build in a way that they can work best with Apple devices. You can face issues if you are using it with windows or any other device other than Apple. For example, Automatic ear detection, Automatic pairing. Music will not automatically pause when you take AirPods out from your ears.</p>
<p>Music controls are features that we can’t miss here. You can have only basic controls. You can miss a lot of features like Siri access.</p>
<p>If you have genuinely original Apple AirPods, there is no hard rule to use them with iPhone, iMac, or iPad. You can also connect AirPods to PC, e.g., Windows 10.</p>

<h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Other than the seamless connectivity of AirPods with Apple products, it offers one of the most excellent perks, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). It helps you when you want to focus on anything and want to tune yourself to get yourself out of this world, and then this product can cancel a big amount of noise around you which you can keep ON and OFF according to your need.</p>
<p>All audio control will still work with windows, and it’s not compulsory to have an Apple device at another end. For example, clicking on the AirPod will pause and play the music, clicking 2 or 3 times forward and backward, and holding AirPods can switch On and Off the ANC mode.</p>
<p>Audio quality is also a big perk while using AirPods with a PC. The regular AirPods are okay in terms of music experience, but there are 5 stars for AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Battery life is also an advantage if you are an AirPod user. The battery life of AirPods is good and can last longer when you connect AirPods to PC.</p>
<p>Besides all these perks, people also like the Build and Look of AirPods. Everyone used to talk about it when they were newly launched. Now AirPods are common and also is a “status symbol,” it’s true, and that’s worth it.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>With windows, you can use only the basic features of AirPods. AirPods will not work to their full potential, and there are also more features that AirPods offers.</p>
<p>Price is a big disadvantage because you can get Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds and Google’s Pixel Buds. Both have some perk’s that you can not get with AirPods. Some also give preference to them look wise also. And also touch control are also better in Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft’s Surface EarBuds.</p>
<p>Wearing AirPods and keeping them in ear’s while working or jogging is tricky. AirPods fall off easily. But on the other hand, Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft’s Surface EarBuds are easy to handle and comfortable to wear compared to AirPods.</p>
<p>AirPods are build in a way that they can work best with Apple devices. You can face issues if you are using it with windows or any other device other than Apple. For example, Automatic ear detection, Automatic pairing. Music will not automatically pause when you take AirPods out from your ears.</p>
<p>Music controls are features that we can’t miss here. You can have only basic controls. You can miss a lot of features like Siri access.</p>

<ul>

<h4 id="1-More-profit-2"><a href="#1-More-profit-2" class="headerlink" title="1.More profit"></a>1.More profit</h4><p>According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.</p>
<p>Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.</p>
<h4 id="2-Larger-audience-2"><a href="#2-Larger-audience-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Larger audience"></a>2.Larger audience</h4><p>Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.</p>
<h4 id="3-No-worries-about-stock-2"><a href="#3-No-worries-about-stock-2" class="headerlink" title="3.No worries about stock"></a>3.No worries about stock</h4><p>When publishing a physical book, you have to constantly worry about keeping the print in stock and meeting readers’ demands. You can avoid such worries when you opt for audiobooks. In the case of audiobooks, there always exists a file accessible for readers to download and read.</p>
<h4 id="4-Easy-discovery-2"><a href="#4-Easy-discovery-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Easy discovery"></a>4.Easy discovery</h4><p>Your book will become easily discoverable when you publish it in the version of an audiobook also. Printed books are comparatively least discoverable online unless they have an audiobook version. The more discoverable your book is, the more is its reach to the targeted audience.</p>
<h4 id="5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2"><a href="#5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Save on time and expenses"></a>5.Save on time and expenses</h4><p>The creation of audiobooks is comparatively easy and low in cost. You can either hire services like ACX and Audiobook Creation Exchange. Or else, you can nowadays also create audiobooks on your own by using online programs such as Filmii.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?"></a>Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?</h2><p>We have seen the advantages of transferring your book into audiobook format in the last section. Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.</li>
<li>Record the audiobook yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p>
<p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li>
<li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.</li>
<li>**Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li>
<li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p>
<p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p>
<p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%. That’s all about ACX.</p>
<p>Now let us see how to make an audiobook of your own.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?</h2><p>Most people don’t convert their books to audiobooks mainly for two reasons.
