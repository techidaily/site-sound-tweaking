## Wondershare Filmora allows you to replace easily and edit the audio in the video

Unfortunately, no application by default on your desktop or laptop, phone, or tablet would get this done. To replace audio in the video, you would need the help of state of the art software. Fortunately, you have Wondershare Filmora at your disposal.

With Wondershare Filmora, you can replace audio in the video, mute audio, detach the audio, and add audio. You can eliminate background noise, organic noise, sound effects, address the sync problem in a video file, and edit the audio in a video without any extensive training or expertise.

* It has a user-friendly interface which makes things simple even for amateurs.
* It supports all common video and audio formats, including WMV, MOV, FLV, MTS, MP4, etc.
* You can move audio, replace it or add new audio to the video without worrying about general loss, which is loss of quality.
* You can export the [edited video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the new or edited audio to various devices, including the cloud and social media sites.
