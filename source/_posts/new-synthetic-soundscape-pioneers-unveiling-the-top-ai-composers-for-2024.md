Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |

| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |

| [9 - Muzeek](#9)       | [10 - Brain.fm](#10)   |

And it's done! Now you can listen to the joined audio to make sure you like it. If it's so, download it to your device or back to cloud storage. Otherwise, just go back to editing.

## CONCLUSION

Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.
