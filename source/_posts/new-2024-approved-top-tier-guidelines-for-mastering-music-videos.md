Even though online video editors do not require a powerful computer, you will still need a computer for using them. And since not everyone has a computer, this can be a huge issue for many users. However, if you upload video files on social media websites, you certainly have a smartphone with you. In that case, you will be glad to know that you can even edit videos on your mobile device. This is made possible thanks to the various free music video editor app options.

● Inside the Mast Music Video Status Maker app, you can find the Add button to import all of your video files.

● Once that is done, go to the Music icon tab, where you can find a wide range of popular music tracks.

● If you want, you can also import music files from your smartphone.

● After that, add the music file under your video file and adjust its position.

● At last, save the video on your phone to share it on any social media platform of your choice.
