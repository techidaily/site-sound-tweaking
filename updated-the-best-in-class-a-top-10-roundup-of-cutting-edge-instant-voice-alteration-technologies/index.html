<h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcast directories?"></a>Part 1. What are podcast directories?</h2><p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube"><a href="#1-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create video-based podcasts seamlessly.

<p>Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).</p>

<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 2.5 billion active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All major OS and web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Spotify"><a href="#2-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory spotify"
                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Spotify on G2</strong>: “I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials.”</li>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#3-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="podcast directory apple podcast"
                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It’s simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more.”</p>

Pandora"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pandora.com/" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours&#x2F;monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

</ul>
<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

<p>**”**Nice alternative to Apple’s. I’ve been well pleased so far. It isn’t always the most intuitive, but I’ve eventually figured out how to achieve almost everything I’ve wanted to. The benefits of adding a show via RSS have become immediately clear.</p>
<p>Being a subscriber to a show and getting early access episodes and bonus material right in my podcast manager makes it easy to stay up with all my shows.”</p>

</ul>
<p>“Wonderful app, the most reliable one I’ve found. Even with accounts, most others lose all your progress data which hasn’t happened once with this, and I’ve switched phones 3 times. The progress tracker is so accurate you can pause on one device, open the same account and continue listening. Most apps can’t even keep things downloaded. Search does take a minute but finds stuff no other app does.”</p>

<p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.</p>
<p>According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:</p>

                ></p>
<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube-1"><a href="#1-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>

Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>

It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<li><strong>User Review of NPR One Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying “features.”</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the screen won’t time out when the app is active.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of “recent” (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.</p>

<p>Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.’</p>

<p>Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you’ll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio"><a href="#What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio" class="headerlink" title="What Is Distortion in Audio?"></a>What Is Distortion in Audio?</h2><p>You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.</p>
<p>Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.</p>
<p>While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.</p>
<p>A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.</p>
<p>In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.</p>
<h2 id="The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion"><a href="#The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="The Difference Between Noise and Distortion"></a>The Difference Between Noise and Distortion</h2><p>Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let’s look at the differences between noise and distortion.</p>
<h4 id="1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal"><a href="#1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal" class="headerlink" title="1. Where It Appears in a Signal"></a>1. Where It Appears in a Signal</h4><p>Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-It-Affects-Signals"><a href="#2-How-It-Affects-Signals" class="headerlink" title="2. How It Affects Signals"></a>2. How It Affects Signals</h4><p>Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.</p>
<h4 id="How-It’s-Measured"><a href="#How-It’s-Measured" class="headerlink" title="How It’s Measured"></a>How It’s Measured</h4><p>You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal’s waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal’s magnitude and frequency content over time.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.</p>

They include:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool"><a href="#Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool"></a>Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool</h3><p>You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.</p>

<p>The Gate filter allows users to control how fast and when the gate opens and what sort of sounds can get in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> This is the level of the decibel at which the gate opens. Set it based on the loudness of the audio distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Attack:</strong> This parameter defines how fast the gate will open. Essentially, the higher the attack value, the slower the gate opens. &#x2F;li&gt;</li>
<li><strong>Knee:</strong> With this parameter, you can control the response of the compressor to the signal that’s crossing the threshold. That means you can apply compression with a delay or instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Make-up gain:</strong> This increases the signal level after it has been processed.</li>
<li><strong>Ratio:</strong> This value controls compression applied to the distortion. It defines how quieter the distortion will be after gating.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction:</strong> This parameter defines the level of signal reduction will be.</li>
<li><strong>Release:</strong> This value defines how fast the gate will close after opening. You can change the Release parameter to suit your preferences.</li>

<p>Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you’ll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-1"><a href="#What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Distortion in Audio?"></a>What Is Distortion in Audio?</h2><p>You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.</p>
<p>Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.</p>
<p>While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.</p>
<p>A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.</p>
<p>In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.</p>
<h2 id="The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-1"><a href="#The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-1" class="headerlink" title="The Difference Between Noise and Distortion"></a>The Difference Between Noise and Distortion</h2><p>Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let’s look at the differences between noise and distortion.</p>
<h4 id="1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-1"><a href="#1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Where It Appears in a Signal"></a>1. Where It Appears in a Signal</h4><p>Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-It-Affects-Signals-1"><a href="#2-How-It-Affects-Signals-1" class="headerlink" title="2. How It Affects Signals"></a>2. How It Affects Signals</h4><p>Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.</p>
<h4 id="How-It’s-Measured-1"><a href="#How-It’s-Measured-1" class="headerlink" title="How It’s Measured"></a>How It’s Measured</h4><p>You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal’s waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal’s magnitude and frequency content over time.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.</p>

<p>Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you’ll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-2"><a href="#What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Distortion in Audio?"></a>What Is Distortion in Audio?</h2><p>You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.</p>
<p>Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.</p>
<p>While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.</p>
<p>A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.</p>
<p>In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.</p>
<h2 id="The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-2"><a href="#The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-2" class="headerlink" title="The Difference Between Noise and Distortion"></a>The Difference Between Noise and Distortion</h2><p>Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let’s look at the differences between noise and distortion.</p>
<h4 id="1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-2"><a href="#1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Where It Appears in a Signal"></a>1. Where It Appears in a Signal</h4><p>Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-It-Affects-Signals-2"><a href="#2-How-It-Affects-Signals-2" class="headerlink" title="2. How It Affects Signals"></a>2. How It Affects Signals</h4><p>Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.</p>
<h4 id="How-It’s-Measured-2"><a href="#How-It’s-Measured-2" class="headerlink" title="How It’s Measured"></a>How It’s Measured</h4><p>You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal’s waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal’s magnitude and frequency content over time.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Remove-Distortion-From-Audio-for-Your-Video-2"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Distortion-From-Audio-for-Your-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video"></a>How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video</h2><p>You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool"></a>Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool</h3><p>You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, let’s look at how to remove distortion from audio using Audacity.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is opening the file. To do this, drag and drop the audio file into Audacity.</li>
<li>Next, you need to select the distorted area before clicking on Effect. Once you have done this, click on the Noise Reduction option.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Doing this will open the Noise reduction window.</li>
<li>Go to the Noise Profile and click on it; this will allow Audacity to know what it should filter out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you’ll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-3"><a href="#What-Is-Distortion-in-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Distortion in Audio?"></a>What Is Distortion in Audio?</h2><p>You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.</p>
<p>Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.</p>
<p>While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.</p>
<p>A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.</p>
<p>In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.</p>
<h2 id="The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-3"><a href="#The-Difference-Between-Noise-and-Distortion-3" class="headerlink" title="The Difference Between Noise and Distortion"></a>The Difference Between Noise and Distortion</h2><p>Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let’s look at the differences between noise and distortion.</p>
<h4 id="1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-3"><a href="#1-Where-It-Appears-in-a-Signal-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Where It Appears in a Signal"></a>1. Where It Appears in a Signal</h4><p>Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-It-Affects-Signals-3"><a href="#2-How-It-Affects-Signals-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How It Affects Signals"></a>2. How It Affects Signals</h4><p>Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.</p>
<h4 id="How-It’s-Measured-3"><a href="#How-It’s-Measured-3" class="headerlink" title="How It’s Measured"></a>How It’s Measured</h4><p>You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal’s waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal’s magnitude and frequency content over time.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Remove-Distortion-From-Audio-for-Your-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Distortion-From-Audio-for-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video"></a>How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video</h2><p>You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-1-Use-an-Online-Audio-Distortion-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool"></a>Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool</h3><p>You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, let’s look at how to remove distortion from audio using Audacity.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is opening the file. To do this, drag and drop the audio file into Audacity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> This is the level of the decibel at which the gate opens. Set it based on the loudness of the audio distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Attack:</strong> This parameter defines how fast the gate will open. Essentially, the higher the attack value, the slower the gate opens. &#x2F;li&gt;</li>
<li><strong>Knee:</strong> With this parameter, you can control the response of the compressor to the signal that’s crossing the threshold. That means you can apply compression with a delay or instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Make-up gain:</strong> This increases the signal level after it has been processed.</li>
<li><strong>Ratio:</strong> This value controls compression applied to the distortion. It defines how quieter the distortion will be after gating.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction:</strong> This parameter defines the level of signal reduction will be.</li>
<li><strong>Release:</strong> This value defines how fast the gate will close after opening. You can change the Release parameter to suit your preferences.</li>
