## The Ultimate Guide to Implementing Audio Keyframes Using Adobe Premiere Pro for Mac Users

# How to Create Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

Keyframing is one of the most vital components in post-production that can be applied to video and audio tracks. For instance, by adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can easily apply properties and values to a specific segment. To do this, you can set up an audio keyframe at the start and another one at the ending of the selected part.

Therefore, with the Premiere Pro keyframe options, you can achieve a gradual flow in your tracks. Without much ado, I’m going to help you set up audio keyframes in Premiere Pro with their vital operations in this post.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

As I have mentioned, to apply adjustments or properties to a specific point in the audio track, we can use Adobe Premiere keyframes. As of now, there are two kinds of keyframes in Adobe Premiere – Clip Keyframe and Track Keyframe. Before you start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you should know their difference.

* _Clip Keyframes_: This would apply audio effects for the selected clip (like adjusting the volume level). The audio keyframe will only apply to the clip that you have selected and not the entire track.
* _Track Keyframes_: These audio keyframes in Premiere are applied to the entire audio track (they have values like Volume and Mute).

Now when we have covered the basics, let’s learn how to set up audio keyframes in Premiere on your Mac.

**Step 1: Add the Audio Track on Adobe Premiere Pro**

To start with, you can launch Adobe Premiere Pro, go to your Project > Import, and simply load any audio track. You can also drag and drop any audio file to the project as well.

![Import Audio Files in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once the audio track is added to the project, you can further drag and drop it to the sequence section (timelines) at the bottom.

![Add Audio to Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-to-timeline-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Show Keyframes for the Track**

The application would automatically render different keyframes already present in the track. For this, you need to first select the ribbon of your audio track from the timeline. Now, just right-click on the working area and click on the “Show Audio Keyframes” button from the context menu.

![Show Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-audio-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

If you want, you can also click on the “Show Keyframes” button that is depicted by a radio/circle icon on the timeline.

![Show Keyframes Button in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-keyframes-button-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 3: Work on Audio Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Now, you can view either clip or track keyframes for the track. For this, you can just right-click the keyframe button on the timeline to get different options. Here, you can choose to get Clip or Track keyframes in Premiere Pro. There are options to mute the entire audio or set up its volume under the track option.

![Track Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/track-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once you have enabled the audio keyframe options in Premiere Pro, you can view keyframes in a highlighted color. You can now take the assistance of the Pen tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select keyframes. This will let you select the starting and ending keyframes in Premiere Pro so that you can easily apply the desired effect to the selected segment.

![Select Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.gif)

## Part 2: How to Fade Audio In/Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

Once you have learned how to use the Adobe Premiere keyframe feature, you can apply all kinds of transitions and effects to a segment. Let’s suppose you wish to implement fade-in or out features for any segment. In this case, we will use the Clip Keyframing option in Premiere Pro to achieve these transitions the way we like.

**Step 1: Get Clip Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Firstly, you can just add any audio track to your Premiere Pro project and drag it to the timeline. You can just click on the show keyframes button to start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro.

If you want, you can just right-click the track, go to the **Show Clip Keyframes** \> **Volume** \> **Level** option. This will show the level of the volume for different keyframes, letting you pick the right segments to fade in and out.

![Show Clip Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-clip-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply Fade-in or Out options**

Once you have clip keyframes in your track, you can easily do whatever you like. You can use the **Pen** tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select the starting and the ending of the clip.

Now, go to the audio segment from the timeline and simply place the audio level up (to fade-in) or down (to fade-out). You can set the audio levels for different segments the way you like to customize these operations in your audio track.

![Fade In and Out in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-in-out-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Pro Tip: Use Inbuilt Fade In/Out Transitions**

With keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can certainly customize the fade in/out options. Though, if you are running short on time, then you can use its inbuilt features for audio adjustments.

For this, you can just go to its **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** option. To fade-out any clip, select the **Crossfade** \> **Exponential Fade** and simply drag and drop to the location of your choice.

![Crossfade Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crossfade-effects-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

In the same way, you can also go to **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** \> **Crossfade** and choose the “Constant Gain” feature. You can drag and drop the Contact Gain effect on any segment to implement the fade-in effect.

That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to set up audio keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro. Since adding keyframes in Premiere can be done automatically, it would save your time in audio editing and post-production. Mostly, the clip audio keyframing is used in Adobe to customize the sound at any desired segment. Apart from fade-in or out, there are tons of other effects that you can apply to your audio tracks with the help of keyframes. Go ahead and try the Adobe Premiere Pro keyframing feature and let us know about your experience in the comments.

Keyframing is one of the most vital components in post-production that can be applied to video and audio tracks. For instance, by adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can easily apply properties and values to a specific segment. To do this, you can set up an audio keyframe at the start and another one at the ending of the selected part.

Therefore, with the Premiere Pro keyframe options, you can achieve a gradual flow in your tracks. Without much ado, I’m going to help you set up audio keyframes in Premiere Pro with their vital operations in this post.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

As I have mentioned, to apply adjustments or properties to a specific point in the audio track, we can use Adobe Premiere keyframes. As of now, there are two kinds of keyframes in Adobe Premiere – Clip Keyframe and Track Keyframe. Before you start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you should know their difference.

* _Clip Keyframes_: This would apply audio effects for the selected clip (like adjusting the volume level). The audio keyframe will only apply to the clip that you have selected and not the entire track.
* _Track Keyframes_: These audio keyframes in Premiere are applied to the entire audio track (they have values like Volume and Mute).

Now when we have covered the basics, let’s learn how to set up audio keyframes in Premiere on your Mac.

**Step 1: Add the Audio Track on Adobe Premiere Pro**

To start with, you can launch Adobe Premiere Pro, go to your Project > Import, and simply load any audio track. You can also drag and drop any audio file to the project as well.

Once the audio track is added to the project, you can further drag and drop it to the sequence section (timelines) at the bottom.

**Step 2: Show Keyframes for the Track**

The application would automatically render different keyframes already present in the track. For this, you need to first select the ribbon of your audio track from the timeline. Now, just right-click on the working area and click on the “Show Audio Keyframes” button from the context menu.

![Show Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-audio-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

If you want, you can also click on the “Show Keyframes” button that is depicted by a radio/circle icon on the timeline.

![Show Keyframes Button in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-keyframes-button-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 3: Work on Audio Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Now, you can view either clip or track keyframes for the track. For this, you can just right-click the keyframe button on the timeline to get different options. Here, you can choose to get Clip or Track keyframes in Premiere Pro. There are options to mute the entire audio or set up its volume under the track option.

![Track Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/track-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once you have enabled the audio keyframe options in Premiere Pro, you can view keyframes in a highlighted color. You can now take the assistance of the Pen tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select keyframes. This will let you select the starting and ending keyframes in Premiere Pro so that you can easily apply the desired effect to the selected segment.

## Part 2: How to Fade Audio In/Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

Once you have learned how to use the Adobe Premiere keyframe feature, you can apply all kinds of transitions and effects to a segment. Let’s suppose you wish to implement fade-in or out features for any segment. In this case, we will use the Clip Keyframing option in Premiere Pro to achieve these transitions the way we like.

**Step 1: Get Clip Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Firstly, you can just add any audio track to your Premiere Pro project and drag it to the timeline. You can just click on the show keyframes button to start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro.

If you want, you can just right-click the track, go to the **Show Clip Keyframes** \> **Volume** \> **Level** option. This will show the level of the volume for different keyframes, letting you pick the right segments to fade in and out.

![Show Clip Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-clip-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply Fade-in or Out options**

Once you have clip keyframes in your track, you can easily do whatever you like. You can use the **Pen** tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select the starting and the ending of the clip.

Now, go to the audio segment from the timeline and simply place the audio level up (to fade-in) or down (to fade-out). You can set the audio levels for different segments the way you like to customize these operations in your audio track.

![Fade In and Out in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-in-out-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Pro Tip: Use Inbuilt Fade In/Out Transitions**

With keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can certainly customize the fade in/out options. Though, if you are running short on time, then you can use its inbuilt features for audio adjustments.

For this, you can just go to its **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** option. To fade-out any clip, select the **Crossfade** \> **Exponential Fade** and simply drag and drop to the location of your choice.

![Crossfade Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crossfade-effects-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

In the same way, you can also go to **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** \> **Crossfade** and choose the “Constant Gain” feature. You can drag and drop the Contact Gain effect on any segment to implement the fade-in effect.

That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to set up audio keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro. Since adding keyframes in Premiere can be done automatically, it would save your time in audio editing and post-production. Mostly, the clip audio keyframing is used in Adobe to customize the sound at any desired segment. Apart from fade-in or out, there are tons of other effects that you can apply to your audio tracks with the help of keyframes. Go ahead and try the Adobe Premiere Pro keyframing feature and let us know about your experience in the comments.

The raw footage produced by all digital cameras contains sound, but more often than not the quality of the audio captured by a camera microphone is underwhelming. Editing a video demands time and access to a powerful video editing app, such as Final Cut Pro or Vegas Pro. In case you don’t have the necessary skills to edit a video using Mac or PC based video editing apps or you simply don’t have enough time to go through the audio editing process, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online solutions that let you **[remove audio from a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** effortlessly.

## 6 Ways to Remove Audio from Video Online in 2022

Each of the online tools presented in this article has a video size limit, which is why you need to make sure that the video file doesn’t exceed the size limit set by the platform. Furthermore, how long the upload is going to last depends on the size of the file, so it is advisable to choose a video that is small in size in order to avoid wasting a lot of time on waiting for the file to upload. Here’s how you can remove audio from videos online.

#### 2. [AudioRemover](https://www.audioremover.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audioremover-online-audio-remover.jpg)

This platform offers a lot of video and audio editing tools for free, and it enables you to stabilize videos, change their size or to extract audio from video. The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the **Browse button** to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the **Upload Video button** to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the **Download File link** to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than **500MB** to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.

#### 3. [Audio-Extractor](http://audio-extractor.net/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-extractor-online-audio-remover.jpg)

If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to **upload a video file** to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, **select MP3, FLAC or OGG** output audio format and click on the **Extract Audio button**. You can then save the audio file on **Google Drive, Dropbox** or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-remove-audio-from-video.jpg)

Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the **Create button**. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the **Download button** to save the video to your computer or the **Edit button** if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the **videos you mute will be watermarked** unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.

#### 5. [Remove Sound From Videos Online](http://removesoundfromvideosonline.blogspot.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/removesoundfromvideosonline.jpg)

The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the **Choose File button** and then select either **Remove Sound or Extract Sound** option. If you want to **Extract Sound** the platform lets you choose from **MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav** output audio file formats. Click on the **Upload&Convert** button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your **mobile phone number** before you can download a file and it **displays ads** after you click on the **Download button**, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.

#### 6. Using [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to Remove Audio From Videos

Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s **Creator Studio**. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the **Creator Studio’s Video tab**. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the **Audio tab**, that is located at the top of the screen next to **Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs**. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the **Featured Tracks** option to **Ambient** and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The **Favor Original Audio** slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. **Drag the slider all the way to the right** in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on **the Position Audio option** to gain access to **the audio waveform**. **Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second** and the video will no longer have sound. **This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero**, which is why it is important to **carefully set the duration of the new audio track** you added to the video. Click on the **Save as New Video option** to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.

**Conclusion**

Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute. Which method of removing audio from videos do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and let us know.

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-extractor-online-audio-remover.jpg)

If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to **upload a video file** to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, **select MP3, FLAC or OGG** output audio format and click on the **Extract Audio button**. You can then save the audio file on **Google Drive, Dropbox** or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-remove-audio-from-video.jpg)

Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the **Create button**. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the **Download button** to save the video to your computer or the **Edit button** if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the **videos you mute will be watermarked** unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.

#### 5. [Remove Sound From Videos Online](http://removesoundfromvideosonline.blogspot.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/removesoundfromvideosonline.jpg)

The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the **Choose File button** and then select either **Remove Sound or Extract Sound** option. If you want to **Extract Sound** the platform lets you choose from **MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav** output audio file formats. Click on the **Upload&Convert** button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your **mobile phone number** before you can download a file and it **displays ads** after you click on the **Download button**, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.

#### 6. Using [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to Remove Audio From Videos

Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s **Creator Studio**. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the **Creator Studio’s Video tab**. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the **Audio tab**, that is located at the top of the screen next to **Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs**. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the **Featured Tracks** option to **Ambient** and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The **Favor Original Audio** slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. **Drag the slider all the way to the right** in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on **the Position Audio option** to gain access to **the audio waveform**. **Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second** and the video will no longer have sound. **This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero**, which is why it is important to **carefully set the duration of the new audio track** you added to the video. Click on the **Save as New Video option** to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.

**Conclusion**

Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute. Which method of removing audio from videos do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and let us know.

## 6 Ways to Remove Audio from Video Online in 2022

Each of the online tools presented in this article has a video size limit, which is why you need to make sure that the video file doesn’t exceed the size limit set by the platform.
