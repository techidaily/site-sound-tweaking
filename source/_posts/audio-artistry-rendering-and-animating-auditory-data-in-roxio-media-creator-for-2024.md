## "Audio Artistry: Rendering and Animating Auditory Data in Roxio Media Creator"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in FCP? (2 ways)

### 1\. Use Pixel Film Studios Audio Visualizer

With [FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2](https://store.pixelfilmstudios.com/product/fcpx-audio-visualizer-volume-2/) from Pixel Film Studios, users now have the ability to see up to 48 audio frequencies with full control over their left and right audio output, all within Final Cut Pro. Users have full control over smoothness, base scale, radius, angular offset, camera position, and animation, all with a single click of the mouse, all in Final Cut Pro X.

FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 has been professionally designed to work seamlessly inside Final Cut Pro X. As a title effect, FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 can be dragged onto media and previewed in real-time. With the published parameters found in the FCPX inspector, users have the ability to make further adjustments with just a few clicks of the mouse.

With the FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 preset pack, users have the ability to compose multiple presets and create their own visualizer every time. Users can choose from template layouts ranging from circles, lines, rectangles, and individual shapes to even an animatable drag zone. Then, within Final Cut Pro, users have total control over spread, color, location, rotation, angle, angle offset, and much more.

### 2\. Use audio waveform animation templates

It could be more convenient to select a few relevant templates directly than using other plugins. You get a full set of 21 templates, including titles, fonts, media streaming logos, sound effects, and colors, with this set of [Waveform Audio Visualization by Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/final-cut-pro-templates/waveform-audio-visualization-305379/) themes. You only need to pick the style you prefer, add your music, and post it with ease on your social media sites. This template is best suited for audiobooks, podcasts, and music videos. Of course, you must subscribe to the platform to download it.

## Part 3\. The best alternative to add audio waveform animation to video?

### Create Audio WaveformVideo in Filmora Audio Visualizer

To add audio waveform animation to video, there is a wide variety of applications. However, Filmora video editor is one of the greatest programs we suggest because you can alter any sound effects on this platform with only one touch. With audio keyframing and an integrated equalization, Filmora can produce unusual sound effects that enhance the audio recording.

Under “Effects” tab, you can find 25 types of audio animation in **Audio Visualizer**.

![audio visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-2.png)

Or you can directly open **“Elements > Recommended”**, and type “audio visualizer” or “music pack” to choose preset waveform animation elements.

Click the Play button in the Preview window and when you feel good about the results, click Export to download the video and your library and successfully share it on various social media platforms.

## Conclusion

Social media content creators, musicians, and VJs can produce stunning videos with any of the music visualizers we've listed in this article. As a professional video editing software, although Final Cut Pro can provide powerful editing features, the operation is more cumbersome and not easy to get started.

● You have to first open the Add Audio in Video tool in any web browser of your choice.

● After opening this website, click on the Choose File option under the Video section. Then, browse and find the video file that you want to edit for adding music.

● Once the right video file is selected, you need to click on the Choose File option under the Audio File section. Then, like the video file, browse and choose the audio file you want to add to your video.

● Now, change the Options toggle to Replace Audio in Video or as you prefer. You can also change the Volume and Position options as desired.

● Finally, click on the Add button to insert music into your video file. Once the video is edited and music has been added, you can then download it on your computer right away.

## Part 3 Free Music Video Editor App

Even though online video editors do not require a powerful computer, you will still need a computer for using them. And since not everyone has a computer, this can be a huge issue for many users. However, if you upload video files on social media websites, you certainly have a smartphone with you. In that case, you will be glad to know that you can even edit videos on your mobile device. This is made possible thanks to the various free music video editor app options.

While there are many video editors for mobile devices, the [Mast Music Video Status Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mast.status.video.edit&hl=en%5FIN&gl=US) is a great option for most. It offers a wide range of templates, video effects, music tracks, stickers, color filters, etc. And since it also has an easy-to-use interface, it is one of the best music video animation maker apps for mobile devices. Even though it is quite straightforward to insert video and audio files in this app for combining them, you can go through the following instructions if you are confused:

● Inside the Mast Music Video Status Maker app, you can find the Add button to import all of your video files.

● Once that is done, go to the Music icon tab, where you can find a wide range of popular music tracks.

● If you want, you can also import music files from your smartphone.

● After that, add the music file under your video file and adjust its position.

● At last, save the video on your phone to share it on any social media platform of your choice.

### Conclusion

You can find video files on all kinds of online social media platforms. These are great for both entertainment and for learning new things online. Moreover, sharing videos with your friends can also be a great way to connect with them. Although, to ensure that you are sharing high-quality videos, you must use a music adder to video tool. Even a high-quality video won’t look the same without the right music.
