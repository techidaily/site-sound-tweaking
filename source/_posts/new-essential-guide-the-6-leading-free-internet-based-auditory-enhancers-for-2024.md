## "3 Budget-Friendly Ways to Seamlessly Add Soundtracks to Your Videos"

The audio or music of video can dramatically affect our perception of a video – no matter whether it's a home movie, a commercial, or a video presentation. But what if all you have is silent footage or with just a crackled and distorted audio file that needs to be replaced, and at this time, you want to add a sound to the video?

To solve this problem, I humbly recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily **add audio to video**, record the voiceover directly and add it to video, or replace the original audio track (stream) with a new audio file.
