Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

## The Role of Dissonant Harmonies and Pacing in Creating Film Music Suspense

Are you a scriptwriter? Are you into dark and mystery movies? The article will surely make you curious!

The filmmakers test different kinds of music for mystery, horror, and thrill-based genre. However, the suspense music takes the lead with its unique dynamics. A suspense background music is everything that takes the people on edge.

The article shall present an insight into the suspense music works in movies and films. A guide to using the music better in an intense environment will also be included. Stay tuned to know three workable platforms to download royalty-free suspense background music. So, let us start?

#### In this article

01 [How Does Suspense Music Work in Film?](#part1)

02 [Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film](#part2)

03 [3 Trendy Sites to Download Royalty Free Suspense Music](#part3)

## Part 1: How Does Suspense Music Work in Film?

It is crucial to understand how suspense music works in the film, especially for beginners. Most movie makers do not know how to build the tension and drop it. The carefully planned dynamics are your way to great mystery output.

The dynamics of the intense music are used to lower the volume and then burst out the music and reveal the big secret. A perfect balance between tension and revulsion creates a more powerful storyline and impacts the audience.

The first factor, tension, is always built slowly and steadily. The suspense background music is deployed in such a situation. Revulsion, on the other hand, is the next moment. It is when the monster is out of the closet. It is the revelation of the big secret of the movie. If tension is the suspenseful music, the revulsion is where horror music comes over.

The right balance between the two soundtracks will mark the success of your upcoming thriller. If the tension lasts longer, the audience breaks it on their own. It often occurs through a joke or breaking silence. Similarly, if the revulsion cues in soon, there is not enough time to build the fear.

![suspense scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/suspense-music-in-film-1.jpg)

For instance, the Main Theme from "Gravity" establishes volume and tension until the movie's climax is reached. Similarly, "Braveheart" uses extensive crescendos to create an intense thriller aura. Most directors always use dissonance to establish a hype. The film "Planet of the Apes" used a mix of soothing and disturbing tones to make the audience uncomfortable.

In such a situation, you can use metal scraping with creepy laughter. The process will be concluded with a hint of echo and reverb for a scary vibe. The sound design is yet another way to build fear. The video game known as "Fall Out" used echoing music to leave a creepy impression.

![fall out game using suspense music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/suspense-music-in-film-2.jpg)

## Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film

Are you a filmmaker? Do you own a production house? Or do you wish to create engaging yet horror content?

With the creative industry blooming extensively, the competition between different production houses is enhancing. It is important to stay one step ahead by making correct suspense music. The sub-section recommends some tips to establish an intense atmosphere in the scenes.

### Crescendos and False Crescendos

A functional tip to create cinematic suspense is by using crescendos. This suspense music continues to develop until the climax is reached. The intense music is gradually built until a startling scream is heard.

Similarly, the false crescendos come with a twist. Instead of hearing a startling scream or a murder, people hear an uncomfortable silence that reveals nothing. It messes up with the audience big time. Don't you agree?

### Repetition

Repetition is yet another technique to create a promising suspenseful aura. The same bundle of chords is repeated, establishing a rhythmic tension. A predictable pattern emphasizes the song and storyline. Additionally, the sudden chord change can be incorporated to release the hype or create a new phase.

### Dissonance

The sound of two or more inharmonious notes develops a dissonant effect. It makes the audience uncomfortable and sends a creepy vibe down the spine. The process of switching between soothing and mysterious sounds keeps the viewers on edge. The dissonant note pairings are extensively used in horror and video films.

### Dynamics

Dynamics is one of the most practiced tricks in the industry to create the needed effect. For starters, the suspense background music is enhanced. The improved pitch takes the audience towards the anticipation of the climax. After that, the chord progression hits the crescendo. The release and silence are a part of the effective dynamics of a movie.

## Part 1: How Does Suspense Music Work in Film?

It is crucial to understand how suspense music works in the film, especially for beginners. Most movie makers do not know how to build the tension and drop it. The carefully planned dynamics are your way to great mystery output.

The dynamics of the intense music are used to lower the volume and then burst out the music and reveal the big secret. A perfect balance between tension and revulsion creates a more powerful storyline and impacts the audience.

The first factor, tension, is always built slowly and steadily. The suspense background music is deployed in such a situation. Revulsion, on the other hand, is the next moment. It is when the monster is out of the closet. It is the revelation of the big secret of the movie. If tension is the suspenseful music, the revulsion is where horror music comes over.

The right balance between the two soundtracks will mark the success of your upcoming thriller. If the tension lasts longer, the audience breaks it on their own. It often occurs through a joke or breaking silence. Similarly, if the revulsion cues in soon, there is not enough time to build the fear.

![suspense scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/suspense-music-in-film-1.jpg)

For instance, the Main Theme from "Gravity" establishes volume and tension until the movie's climax is reached. Similarly, "Braveheart" uses extensive crescendos to create an intense thriller aura. Most directors always use dissonance to establish a hype. The film "Planet of the Apes" used a mix of soothing and disturbing tones to make the audience uncomfortable.

In such a situation, you can use metal scraping with creepy laughter. The process will be concluded with a hint of echo and reverb for a scary vibe. The sound design is yet another way to build fear. The video game known as "Fall Out" used echoing music to leave a creepy impression.

## Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film

Are you a filmmaker? Do you own a production house? Or do you wish to create engaging yet horror content?

With the creative industry blooming extensively, the competition between different production houses is enhancing. It is important to stay one step ahead by making correct suspense music. The sub-section recommends some tips to establish an intense atmosphere in the scenes.

### Crescendos and False Crescendos

A functional tip to create cinematic suspense is by using crescendos. This suspense music continues to develop until the climax is reached. The intense music is gradually built until a startling scream is heard.

Similarly, the false crescendos come with a twist. Instead of hearing a startling scream or a murder, people hear an uncomfortable silence that reveals nothing. It messes up with the audience big time. Don't you agree?

### Repetition

Repetition is yet another technique to create a promising suspenseful aura. The same bundle of chords is repeated, establishing a rhythmic tension. A predictable pattern emphasizes the song and storyline. Additionally, the sudden chord change can be incorporated to release the hype or create a new phase.

### Dissonance

The sound of two or more inharmonious notes develops a dissonant effect. It makes the audience uncomfortable and sends a creepy vibe down the spine. The process of switching between soothing and mysterious sounds keeps the viewers on edge. The dissonant note pairings are extensively used in horror and video films.

### Dynamics

Dynamics is one of the most practiced tricks in the industry to create the needed effect. For starters, the suspense background music is enhanced. The improved pitch takes the audience towards the anticipation of the climax. After that, the chord progression hits the crescendo. The release and silence are a part of the effective dynamics of a movie.

The quality of sound that you hear depends on various factors, and an appropriate **audio format** is one of them. While each type of acoustic file has its own significance, choosing the best audio format as per the target player, expected audience, and/or supporting videos or images (if any) is something that needs much consideration to offer a flawless listening experience.

With that said, here you will learn about some of the most common sound file types, which among them could be the **best audio format** according to your requirements, and a couple of important points that you must keep in might while picking an extension for your media preparations.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

_You may also interest: [YouTube to WAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>_

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

_You may also like: [Best AIFF to MP3 Converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

_Check this [MP3 editor and convert video to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) easily._

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

What's the difference between common audio file formats like MP3,  WAV, and FLAC? Watch the video below to learn more.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

_You may also interest: [YouTube to WAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>_

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound.
