![Mute audio](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-2.jpg)

* Manage volume control for all events of loaded track: Use Volume Slider switch that is denoted by dB.
* Pan Slider: It is possible to make adjustments for audio pan using a slider named as Center. Users can slide it to left side or right side as per audio project requirements.

**Note:**

1\. Put on your headphone to better verify the output result.

2\. To reset the volume, just double click on the options.

Those who want to control volume separately for different portions of audio file can go to **Audio Envelop** (go Insert > Audio Envelopes)and then make all essential settings as:

**Mute:** A blue line is visible on timeline at your selected audio event, simply double click over it for addition of a specific point and then right click for mute adjustments. From appeared drop down menu you can select muted or not muted and the adjustments will be effective on right side of event point.

**Volume:** Check the deep blue line on selected event and then double click over it for addition of a marking point. Drag this point up or down for appropriate volume settings and use right click option for additional adjustments.

#### Section 5: Noise Removal

One classic feature of Vegas Pro is its Sound Restoration in Audio FX control. But it does not work as good compared to Audacity. Check this article to [see how to remove noise from audio](http://www.technospot.net/blogs/remove-background-noise-sony-vegas-audacity/)using Sony Vegas Pro & Audacity.

Or check this video tutorial below:

#### Section 6: Apply unique Audio Effects

If you want to add specific effects to your audio files then use two simple methods on Vegas Pro with its Audio FX tool: One is to add effects on entire video file and second option is to make changes to specific layers of audio project. Use these steps to achieve great results:

**To entire audio layer**

![To entire audio layer ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-9.jpg)

**To an individual portion of the audio layer**

![To portion](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-10.jpg)

**Step 1:** First of all go to Track Description Box and then press the Track FX icon, an audio track FX will soon appear on your device screen. The three basic controls are always activated, that are Track Compressor, Track EQ and Track Noise Gate.

![Audio track FX ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-11.jpg)

For additional personalization you need to use plug-in chain button from right corner.

![Audio plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-12.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now select any desired effect from list that can make your audio track more impressive and press Add; once applied then hit OK.

![ Add audio effect](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-13.jpg)

#### Recommendation

The Vegas Pro is rated as a professional editing software tool due to its advanced user interface, high price range and availability on Mac devices only. If you are searching for some video editing tools that can work on Windows as well as Mac devices then [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best options for you all.
