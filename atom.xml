A good soundtrack can drastically increase the overall quality of a video since barely audible dialogues or background noises distract a viewer. Even adding simple effects like fade in or fade out can make a huge difference in how well a video is accepted by your friends on social media. If you would like to learn how to fade audio in your videos, you’re at the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to fade in or fade out an audio clip.</p><h2 id="Fading-Audio-in-Adobe-Rush-1"><a href="#Fading-Audio-in-Adobe-Rush-1" class="headerlink" title="Fading Audio in Adobe Rush"></a>Fading Audio in Adobe Rush</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that was released a short while ago doesn’t seem to be living up to the high standard we can commonly expect from Adobe’s products. The app doesn’t feature fade in&#x2F;out options and its audio editing capabilities are limited. The only way you can fade audio with Adobe Rush is to open the project in Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but in order to be able to do so, you have to be subscribed to the Adobe’s Creative Cloud.</p><p>Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on the other hand, offers all tools you’re going to need to produce a YouTube video including the fade in and fade out audio effects at a more affordable price. Here’s how you can fade audio in Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-audio-in-filmora-9.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="Fading-Audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Fading-Audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Fading Audio in Wondershare Filmora"></a>Fading Audio in Wondershare Filmora</h2><h4 id="1-Import-video-and-audio-files-into-Filmora"><a href="#1-Import-video-and-audio-files-into-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Import video and audio files into Filmora"></a>1. Import video and audio files into Filmora</h4><p>Most video clips contain an audio track, but in some cases, you might want to remove the clip’s original audio and replace it with music, narration, dialogue or atmospheric sounds you choose. You can import an audio file into Filmora by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and selecting the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-media-panel.JPG"                                     ></p><p>Alternatively, you can just drag and drop an audio file from the folder to the Media Panel. Filmora also features a rich library of royalty-free music you can use to select a soundtrack for your video. Drag and drop the video or audio file into the timeline from the Media Panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-track.JPG"                                     ></p><h4 id="2-Fading-audio-in-Filmora"><a href="#2-Fading-audio-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="2. Fading audio in Filmora"></a>2. Fading audio in Filmora</h4><p><strong>Method 1: With Audio panel</strong></p><p>Clicking on the Edit button, located at the end of the software’s toolbar will grant you the access to the software’s audio panel where you can easily adjust the volume of the clip, select one of Equalizer presets or change the Pitch of the audio file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-panel.JPG"                                     ></p><p>Fade in and Fade out sliders are located at the top of the Audio panel and you can drag the handle on the slider or you can insert new Fade in or Fade out values manually in the boxes next to the sliders. You can click play and decide if you like the effect you created before you click OK to confirm the changes.</p><p><strong>Method 2: Directly from Timeline</strong></p><p>In case you want to fade an audio quickly you can do so directly from the timeline. Just click on the handle at the beginning or the end of the audio file and then drag it to adjust the duration of the effect. Both of Fade in or Fade out handles can be easily moved directly on the timeline, even if you set their values from the Audio Panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fading-audio-in-filmora-9-timeline.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Filmora features a lot of sound effects, like the Phone Ring, Explosion or Car Horn that can be combined with the Fade in or Fade out effect to create a better soundtrack for your video. When ready, click on the Export button and proceed to choose the video’s resolution, file format or export destination. The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly.

Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors"><a href="#Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Online Audio Extractors"></a>Top 6 Online Audio Extractors</h2><p>The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors. So, before you decide which platform you are going to use, you must first check the size and file format of your video. Let’s take a look at some of the best online audio extractors you can use to create high-quality audio files for free.</p><h4 id="2-Online-Audio-Converter"><a href="#2-Online-Audio-Converter" class="headerlink" title="2. Online Audio Converter"></a>2. Online Audio Converter</h4><p>The wide range of supported file formats, as well as the straightforward audio extraction process, make this platform one the best choices for anyone who wants to create an audio file from a video. The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is <strong>2048mb</strong>, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or some other online destination, you just have to select the <strong>output format</strong> and <strong>the quality</strong> of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on <strong>the Advanced settings option</strong> if you would like to add <strong>fade in and fade out effects</strong>, try to <strong>remove voice</strong> or change the <strong>bitrates and sample rates</strong>. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> when ready and proceed to <strong>save the file</strong> to your computer or at some online destination.</p><h4 id="3-AudioExtracter"><a href="#3-AudioExtracter" class="headerlink" title="3. AudioExtracter"></a>3. AudioExtracter</h4><p>This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files <strong>automatically</strong>, but it also offers a variety of <strong>video, photo and audio editing tools</strong> you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in <strong>MP4, AVI</strong> or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than <strong>500mb</strong> and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an <strong>output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file</strong> you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to <strong>convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,</strong> so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.</p><h4 id="4-Online-Video-Converter"><a href="#4-Online-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4. Online Video Converter"></a>4. Online Video Converter</h4><p>Online Video Converter supports almost all video file formats, which means that you can extract audio files from virtually any video clip, but keep in mind that the maximum size of the file you’d like to convert can’t exceed the <strong>1000mb limit</strong>. The audio extraction process is rather simple as you just have to <strong>upload the file</strong> and wait for the platform to prepare your file for conversion. Afterward, you just have to <strong>select the output format</strong> and click on the <strong>Start button</strong> and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the <strong>QR code</strong> to download it to a <strong>Smartphone or tablet</strong>. What’s more, you can also use the <strong>Online Video Converter</strong> to extract audio files from <a class="link"   href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter" >YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Simply paste the video’s URL and then proceeds to choose the output format, and click on the <strong>More Settings</strong> option if you want to designate <strong>the start and end points</strong> of the new audio file. Click on the <strong>Start button</strong> to commence the extraction process and use one of the available methods to download the file.</p><h4 id="5-Video2Mp3"><a href="#5-Video2Mp3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video2Mp3"></a>5. Video2Mp3</h4><p>YouTubers who already have channels on the world’s largest video sharing platform can use the Video2Mp3 tool to turn their videos into MP3 files effortlessly. You don’t even have to be a registered YouTube user to convert videos stored on this platform with Video2Mp3, because you can just pick any video that is uploaded to YouTube and turn it into an MP3 file with this powerful audio extraction tool. Once you’ve pasted the video’s <strong>URL into the platform’s URL box</strong>, simply click on the Convert to MP3 button. You will then have to specify the preferred <strong>output format</strong>, or use the platform’s <strong>Search and Convert</strong> option that lets you search for videos on <strong>Dailymotion, Clipfish or YouTube</strong> and convert them. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> to initiate the conversion process, <strong>insert the name of the artist and title</strong> of the song you’re converting and proceed to download the video.</p><h4 id="6-Zamzar"><a href="#6-Zamzar" class="headerlink" title="6. Zamzar"></a>6. Zamzar</h4><p>You can convert a video file with Zamzar in just three quick steps, upload a file from an online destination or from your device, <strong>pick the output format</strong> and click on the Convert button. Once the file is converted you can save it to your computer, however, the free version of the Zamzar platform offers only limited options. In case you would like to be able to convert files that are <strong>larger than 200mb</strong>, be able to <strong>convert via email</strong>, have access to <strong>online storage space</strong>, then you should <strong>choose one of the available subscription plans</strong>. Keep in mind that all versions of the platform <strong>limit the concurrent number of conversions</strong>, which means that even if you purchase a subscription plan, you are going to be able to make <strong>25, 50 or 100</strong> concurrent conversions each month, depending on the plan you choose.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Audio Recording Software to Capture Your Voice Easily <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating audio files from videos you record with your phones and digital cameras doesn’t require a lot of effort since online audio extractors enable you to complete the entire process in just a couple of minutes.

To edit audio clips in iMovie on your iPhones or iPads, you can follow the guide belo</p><h4 id="Move-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Move-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Move an Audio Clip"></a>Move an Audio Clip</h4><p>You can transfer the whole audio clip, except the background music, to another location.</p><ul><li>Touch and hold the purple or blue audio clip with your project open in the timeline until it comes over the timeline bar.</li><li>Drag the clip to another place and release.</li></ul><h4 id="Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration"><a href="#Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration"></a>Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration</h4><p>Step 1. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.</p><p>Step 2. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won’t move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip’s end.</p><p>Step 3. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.</p><h4 id="Split-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Split-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Split an Audio Clip"></a>Split an Audio Clip</h4><p>There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie. You can remove unwanted parts or adjust each section’s duration, volume, or speed while you split a clip.</p><p>Step 1. With your launched project in the timeline, scroll the timeline to the playhead’s position where you want to split the audio.</p><p>Step 2. Click the audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 3. Now, click the <strong>Actions</strong> button, and select the <strong>Split</strong> tab.</p><p>Or, you can tap the clip (it becomes outlined in yellow), then swipe above the playhead as if you were placing your finger to slide over it.</p><h4 id="Detach-the-Audio-Part-from-a-Video"><a href="#Detach-the-Audio-Part-from-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Detach the Audio Part from a Video"></a>Detach the Audio Part from a Video</h4><p>You can detach the video clip’s audio to remove or edit it as a separate video clip.</p><p>Step 1. When the project is open in the timeline, select a video clip and display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 2. Tap the <strong>Actions</strong> button, then tap <strong>Detach</strong>.</p><p>Step 3. A new blue-colored audio clip will then appear below the video project. You can now move, edit, or delete the audio clip separately from its parent video clip.</p><h4 id="Move-Audio-to-the-Foreground-or-Background"><a href="#Move-Audio-to-the-Foreground-or-Background" class="headerlink" title="Move Audio to the Foreground or Background"></a>Move Audio to the Foreground or Background</h4><p>To ensure the sound in your video clips can listen above the background music, iMovie implies audio “ducking”. Ducking lowers the background music clips’ volume whenever there’s a video clip whose sound is playing simultaneously.</p><p>You can select which audio clips are in the foreground or the background.</p><p>Step 1. Select the timeline’s audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 2. Hit the <strong>Actions</strong> tab and proceed with selecting the <strong>Foreground</strong> or <strong>Background</strong>.</p><p>The clip color changes to indicate whether it’s the background music (green) or foreground audio (blue or purple).</p><h2 id="Part-2-An-Easier-Way-to-Edit-Audio-Clips"><a href="#Part-2-An-Easier-Way-to-Edit-Audio-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: An Easier Way to Edit Audio Clips"></a>Part 2: An Easier Way to Edit Audio Clips</h2><p>Windows users might be wandering for an alternative to iMovie as this software tool is only compatible with Mac and iOS devices.

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p><p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p><p>So, here we go!</p><h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p><p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p><p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p><h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p><p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p><h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p><p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p><h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p><p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p><p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p><p><img

Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio"></a>1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio</h3><p>A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.</p><p>There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the <strong>Creator Studio Classic</strong> tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Add Music to YouTube Video"                ></p><p>Select Audio Option</p><p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the <strong>Audio</strong> option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the <strong>ADD TO VIDEO</strong> button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.</p><p>You can check the detailed information about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to add music to YouTube video here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library"                ></p><p>YouTube Audio Library Interface</p><p>Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos"><a href="#3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

It means you give your audio track a real orchestral vibe using different audio samples.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Different Types of audio samples including strings, brass, keys &amp; choir, etc.</li><li>Perfect for Beginners as well as slightly experienced music composers <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sonatina-symphonic-orchestra.JPG"                      alt="Sonatina Orchestra"                ></li></ul><h3 id="4-Keyzone-Classic"><a href="#4-Keyzone-Classic" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyzone Classic"></a>4. Keyzone Classic</h3><p>Keyzone Classic is a piano-based plugin that provides acoustic samples from different pianos. The plugin can be installed on any operating system, be it Mac or Windows, and works with the majority of DAWs.</p><p>If you want to add a piece of soft piano music in the background of your audio track, Keyzone Classic is the perfect option. Unlike the previous <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> in our list, Keyzone Classic isn’t a complete bundle, which makes it lightweight and easy-to-use.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Get a variety of presets including Yamaha Grand Piano, Steinway Grand Piano, Basic Electric Piano</li><li>Lightweight and easy-to-install.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/keyzoneclassic.JPG"                      alt="Keyzone Classic"                ></p><h3 id="5-Plogue-Sforzando"><a href="#5-Plogue-Sforzando" class="headerlink" title="5. Plogue Sforzando"></a>5. Plogue Sforzando</h3><p>Sforzando is one of the most powerful sample players that’ll free you from relying on proprietary formats for creating your own SFZ file formats. With Sforzando, you can create and share instruments for free, as well as commercial purposes.</p><p>Although it might not be a suitable option for beginners or even intermediate composers. <em>Why?</em> Because there is no fancy UI that’ll help you navigate through different elements. Everything needs to be done from scratch, that too, at the SFZ file level itself. In a nutshell, you must be a skilled and highly experienced composer to operate Plogue Sforzando.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Uses SFZ file format, which is royalty-free, which means you can create and distribute instruments without any restrictions.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sforzando.JPG"                      alt="Plogue Sforzando"                ></p><h3 id="6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin"><a href="#6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6. Simple Sound Delay Plugin"></a>6. Simple Sound Delay Plugin</h3><p>As the name implies, Simple Sound Delay is a virtual signal delaying AAX and VST plugin. It can be used in any DAW to delay audio signals with extremely accurate precision. The plugin allows you to postpone time by setting a time-frame in milliseconds or using the samples.</p><p>However, being one of the standalone and <strong>free VST plugins</strong>, Sound Delay can only be used to delay audio signals. Apart from this, it doesn’t provide any functionality whatsoever. Sound Delay is an appropriate option for music composers who have already installed dozens of individual VST plugins and want a new one that’ll help them delay audio signals as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Delay Audio Signals in milliseconds or using samples</li><li>Delay mid &amp; side-channels separately <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sounddelay.JPG"                      alt="Simple Sound Delay Plugin"                ></li></ul><h3 id="7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin"><a href="#7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="7. Tube Amplifier Plugin"></a>7. Tube Amplifier Plugin</h3><p>Tube Amplifier is a VST plugin that applies asymmetric tube triode overdrive to your project. By no means, TubeAmp is the right choice for a beginner as one must be familiar with tube-triode.</p><p>However, if you’re an experienced music composer, Tube Amplifier will fit your studio perfectly. As we mentioned earlier, it can be used to apply asymmetric tube triode overdrive, which is usually found in single-tube microphone preamp boxes. It also contains a low-pass filter that’ll help you imitate a low-quality tube-triode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Asymmetric tube triode overdrive</li><li>Two processing modes</li><li>Additional output saturation stage</li><li>Stereo and multi-channel processing <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/tubeamp.JPG"                      alt="Tube Amplifier Plugin"                ></li></ul><h3 id="8-Ozone-Imager-V2"><a href="#8-Ozone-Imager-V2" class="headerlink" title="8. Ozone Imager V2"></a>8. Ozone Imager V2</h3><p>Ozone Imager V2 is probably one of the <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> as it allows a music composer to have full control over the width of the sounds. The tool has three different vectorscope meters that instantly show the stereo width and help you widen or narrow the sounds precisely as per the project requirements.</p><p>Ozone Imager also has a dedicated “Stereoize” feature that’ll help you turn mono sounds into stereo without any reverb. This will make it easier to enhance the overall audio effects and give a professional touch to your tracks.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Stereoize the sounds with no need for doubling</li><li>Visualize the sounds using vectorscope meters to precisely adjust their width <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ozone-imager.JPG"                      alt="Ozone Imager V2"                ></li></ul><h3 id="9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs"><a href="#9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs" class="headerlink" title="9. RS-W2395c by Fuse Audio Labs"></a>9. RS-W2395c by Fuse Audio Labs</h3><p>RS-W2395c is a classic Baxandall equalizer that’s perfect for creating audio effects for your rock band. It offers an extremely straightforward UI, which will make it easier for all the hobbyist music composers to switch low and mid-bands without having to dive deeper into the “Settings” menu.</p><p>The dedicated high-shelf will give you the liberty to carve darkening instruments and voices. This will help you compose audio tracks that stand out in the crowd.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Extremely Flexible UI</li><li>Easily Control Mid &amp; Low Bands for your track <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fuseaudiolabs.JPG"                      alt="RS-W2395c by Fuse Audio Labs"                ></li></ul><h3 id="10-Sound-Recovery"><a href="#10-Sound-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="10.

Sound Recovery</h3><p>Unlike other <strong>free VST plugins</strong> in our list, Sound Recovery is specifically tailored to repair low-quality audio tracks to make them sound better and reach the professional level. The plugin will help you adjust mid &amp; high frequencies to an optimal level or add them if they’re missing in a soundtrack.

Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> tab, and select your preferred title. There are plentiful title templates in Filmora video editor for different scenarios, such as gaming, social media, education &amp; tutorial, travel, and sports. If you just want to add plain text, you can go to the Basic category or Plain Text category to add simple text without any animation.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Type text to build the Lyrics you want</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"                      alt="customize lyric texts"                ></p><p> Double click the title in the timeline and then click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button to go to the Advanced Text Edit window. From there, you can write your lyrics, add a text box, change colors and font, and add animations to the lyrics.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Transitions to Lyric Text</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg"                      alt="add transitions to lyric texts"                ></p><p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab and select the desired transition. For example, you can search warp on the search bar, and it will list many wrap effects. You can choose one wrap transition effect first and then double click the transition to set its duration and position.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add Effects to a lyric video</strong></p><p>To make the lyric video more vivid, we can add some special effects to the lyric frames. Filmora provides lots of visual effects in the Effects tab, including trending effects, and effects for different scenarios. Like the video below, it uses Extreme effects.
