**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, web-based

Conducting remote interviews with Ringr is easy, as you just have to schedule the interview and then connect via the Ringr app. As soon as the conversation starts, Ringer will start recording it and once the conversation is finished the audio file will be automatically uploaded to the Ringr platform.

The app will then merge the files it created for each participant of the conversation to improve the audio’s quality, although all recordings created with the Basic subscription plan are going to be saved as Mono MP3 files. Once the automatic audio editing process is completed you can proceed to download the conversation you recorded, but keep in mind that the Conference Calling options are only available if you choose a Premium or Enterprise, subscription models.

**Pros**

* Enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews
* Efficient call scheduling tools
* The number of calls you can make with Ringr isn’t limited
* Quick download process

**Cons**

* The quality of the recording depends on the pricing plan you purchase
* No audio editing tools

**Price:**  $39,95

**Compatibility:** macOS

ecamm Call Recorder for Skype is not a podcast recording software product, as it is primarily used as a tool that [records Skype conversations](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Podcasters who often conduct interviews through Skype can rely on this macOS application to capture their Skype calls.
