It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.

Why Do You Need An Audio Mixer For Streaming?

If you've ever wondered why some people's audio sounds so much better than others when streaming, it's likely because they're using an audio mixer.

An audio mixer is a console that takes multiple audio signals and combines them into one signal. This allows you to control the individual levels of each sound, as well as add special effects like EQ and reverb.

While you don't necessarily need an audio mixer to stream, it can certainly make your life easier. So, if you're planning on doing any sort of professional streaming, this device is a must-have. However, they can be expensive, complicated to use, and sometimes add latency to your live audio.
