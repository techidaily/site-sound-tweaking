Alternatively, you have one more option: you can add songs to iMovie from Spotify. If you are willing to learn how to add songs to iMovie from Spotify, the process is quite simple. Firstly transfer your Spotify music/songs to your music library. Then open iMovie > Add media> Add Music and select your desired song/music/track from the library.
