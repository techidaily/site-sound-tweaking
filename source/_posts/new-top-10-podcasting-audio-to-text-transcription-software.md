Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a 'Change Pitch' feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.

The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4\. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3\. With Audacity, you also get the 'To' and 'From' controls if you plan to change the pitch manually.

Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the 'File' section, followed by the 'Open' option.
