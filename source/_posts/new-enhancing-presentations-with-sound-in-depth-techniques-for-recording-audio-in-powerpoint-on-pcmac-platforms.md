## Part 3: 7 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make Creative Slideshows

Now that all the Windows and Mac users are satisfied after learning about PowerPoint voice recording, it’s the perfect time to share some very useful tips. In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.

### 1\. Minimalism

The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that 'Less is More.' While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.

The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences' interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.

### 2\. Use Design Elements

Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.

Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.

### 3\. One Story at a Time

A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.

If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.

### 4\. Alignment and Symmetry

While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.

### 5\. Formatting and Settings

Making your slides creative doesn't mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.

Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.

### 6\. Add and Adjust

Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.

For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.

### 7\. Animation

Static slides are too mainstream for today's fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.

## Part 3: 7 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make Creative Slideshows

Now that all the Windows and Mac users are satisfied after learning about PowerPoint voice recording, it’s the perfect time to share some very useful tips. In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.

### 1\. Minimalism

The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that 'Less is More.' While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.

The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences' interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.

### 2\. Use Design Elements

Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.

Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.

### 3\. One Story at a Time

A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.

If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.

### 4\. Alignment and Symmetry

While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.

### 5\. Formatting and Settings

Making your slides creative doesn't mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.

Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.

### 6\. Add and Adjust

Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.

For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.

### 7\. Animation

Static slides are too mainstream for today's fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.

### Last Words

The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint. A complete step-by-step guideline has been shared for both Mac and Windows users on audio recording with PowerPoint. We also talked about 7 tips that will surely improve the quality of your slides.
