The following section of this article is going to share tips and tricks that could be adopted. These will help you to get better and improved quality while editing audio.

### 1\. Restore Bass

The first tip that we are going to introduce is restoring the bass of the media file. You can do this by using the Parametric Equalizer and dragging it onto the timeline. With an equalizer, you can play with different audio frequencies. Whatsoever suits the best, you can set it.

### 2\. Atmosphere Setting

Its essential to first of all create an atmosphere. For this, you can mix sounds, add reverb and even adjust the loudness. An ambiance audio tag can be used for background noise. You need to set the scene for your music or the dialogue.

### 3\. Compress the Audio

To make the audio better and more consistent, it is essential to compress it. Like the name is presenting, compression lowers the volume of loud parts, increases the volume of fairly quiet parts, it compresses the waveform of audio. After compression, your audio sounds instantly better, especially the voices.

### 4\. Dialogue Adjustments

You can unify different recordings for a common loudness if you tag audio clips as Dialogue. If you plan to add a voiceover to your video, then you must improve the clarity, reduce or remove any background noise and also, adjust the reverb. Subtitles could be added to make the conversation understandable in your video.

### 5\. Remove Noise

The noise of the computer fan or the weird hissing noise of the microphone and other similar things are referred to as Background noise. This can become a distracting element. While editing the audio, it matters that you remove the background noise because it does not get automatically removed. So, to have good audio, always remove background noise.

### Bottom Line

If background noise is bothering you, then this problem is resolved. The article above has shared how to remove noise from video in premiere pro. The easy step-by-step guide for removing background noise with Premiere Pro has been shared.

To remove background noise, Premiere Pro is not the only editor. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is another stunning and known video editor. You can use the tool to remove background noise from your videos. With this editor, you can also mute your clips.

Not just this, but the editor has many more classic features. Filmora allows keyframing, motion tracking, and doing cool edits with a split-screen.
