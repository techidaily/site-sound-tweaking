The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that 'Less is More.' While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.

The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences' interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.

### 2\. Use Design Elements

Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements.

Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.

### 3\. One Story at a Time

### 5\. Formatting and Settings

Making your slides creative doesn't mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.

Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.

### 6\. Add and Adjust

Always follow the â€˜Add and Adjustâ€™ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.

For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.

### 7\. Animation

Static slides are too mainstream for today's fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiencesâ€™ attention is animation.

Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.

### 5\. Formatting and Settings

Making your slides creative doesn't mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.

## Part 3: 7 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make Creative Slideshows

Now that all the Windows and Mac users are satisfied after learning about PowerPoint voice recording, itâ€™s the perfect time to share some very useful tips. In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.

### 1\. Minimalism

The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that 'Less is More.' While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.

The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences' interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.

### 2\. Use Design Elements

Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.

Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.

### 3\. One Story at a Time

A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.

If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.

### 4\. Alignment and Symmetry

While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.

### 5\. Formatting and Settings

Making your slides creative doesn't mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.

Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you.

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

It has been a little over fifteen years since Ben Hammersley coined the term podcast. During this time, radio and TV stations, as well as people from all walks of life, have embraced this new medium of spreading information through either audio or video files.

Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics. Listening to a podcast from a Smartphone without a player is not an option, which is why we made a selection of some of the best podcast player apps for iPhone and Android devices.

## Best Free Podcast Player Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Nearly all **podcast player apps** have similar features. You can discover new shows, limit how many episodes can be downloaded to your device or reduce silences to the very minimum.

The list of features a podcast player provides should help you determine if that app is the right choice for you. Here are some of the best free podcast player apps for iOS and Android devices you can find on the market in 2019.

![Best Podcast Player App - Pocket Casts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pocket-casts-podcast-player.jpg)

The appâ€™s functional design makes it easy to find and manage podcasts by enabling you to create playback queues effortlessly. **Trimming silence, skipping intros or streaming episodes** without downloading them are just a few among countless options the Pocket Casts app offers.

Moreover, the **Car Play feature** enables you to play audio and video podcasts wherever you go. You can also download podcasts if you want to listen to them while you are offline.

Besides, you can play all episodes on your TV or your sound system using the **Airplay and Chromecast integrations**. The only downside is that you have to **purchase the annual or monthly plan** if you want to use all of the Pocket Castsâ€™ podcasting options.

### 7\. Apple Podcasts

### 8\. Spotify

### 9\. Overcast

### 10\. Castro

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241)

Managing large numbers of episodes with Castro wonâ€™t take much more than a few moments of your time. Subscribe to a podcast you like, and all of the latest episodes will land in the New tab.

The app is free for just ten days, afterward, you must upgrade to Laughable Insider if you want to have access to all the shows and episodes this podcast player has to offer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app youâ€™re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
