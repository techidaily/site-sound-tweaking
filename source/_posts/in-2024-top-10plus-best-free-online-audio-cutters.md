## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

_You may also interest: [YouTube to WAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>_

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

_You may also like: [Best AIFF to MP3 Converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

_Check this [MP3 editor and convert video to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) easily._

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

| MKV          | MP3                         | Lossy Compressed               |
| TS           | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| 3GP          | Lossy Compressed            |                                |
| MPEG-2       | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| WEBM         | Vorbis                      | Lossy Compressed               |

However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

| MKV          | MP3                         | Lossy Compressed               |
| TS           | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| 3GP          | Lossy Compressed            |                                |
| MPEG-2       | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| WEBM         | Vorbis                      | Lossy Compressed               |

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

You can import your audio files and media files into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-2.jpg)

### Step 2\. Click on the Effect Rack

Select the "Effects" rack once the audio file has been imported into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition click effect rack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-3.jpg)

Altеrnativеly, choose one of the effects using thе arrows on thе right sidе of thе scrееn. If you click on thе whitе arrow you will opеn a dropdown list. Stereo imagery is available by just simply putting your mouse cursor over it. The Center Channel Extractor will be displayed in a new list.

![adobe audition click stereo imagery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove. It's easy to see that your vocals have been reduced when you preview it.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

![click discrimination](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-8.jpg)

### Step 5\. Apply the Effect

On the Effects Rack panel, click Apply at the bottom of the effect window. Your audio file's length may determine the amount of time it takes Adobe Audition to apply the effects.

![adobe audition apply effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-9.jpg)

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

To use the music tracks on your mix or videos, export them without vocals. Go to Filе/Export/Filе to еxport a filе. Thе audio format for thе nеw music filе you can sеlеct rangеs from MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF and many othеrs.

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.

![adobe audition click export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-10.jpg)

A Tip for Enhancing Results

To get perfect results, I recommend always listening back while you adjust these sliders, since audio quality varies from one to another.

![adobe audition click stereo imagery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove. It's easy to see that your vocals have been reduced when you preview it.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

![click discrimination](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-8.jpg)

### Step 5\. Apply the Effect

On the Effects Rack panel, click Apply at the bottom of the effect window. Your audio file's length may determine the amount of time it takes Adobe Audition to apply the effects.

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.
