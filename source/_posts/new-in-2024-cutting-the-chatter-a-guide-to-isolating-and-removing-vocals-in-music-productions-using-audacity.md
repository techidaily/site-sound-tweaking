## **Method 1: Remove Vocals Using Audacity Vocal Reduction Tool**

The first method of removing vocals in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is using the built-in vocal remover. This method is effective in completely removing vocals depending on how much processing is on the vocal. Even if the vocals are not completely removed, the method will reduce the volume significantly to give you great results. Let’s have a look at how to isolate vocal audacity with this method.

### **Step 1: Open Audacity**

The first thing you need to do is open the Audacity software in preparation for the vocal removal.

![open audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-1.JPG)

### **Step 2: Import the Audio Track**

Go to File > Import > Audio to import the audio track you want to edit.

Select the song or audio track from which you want to remove the vocals. This allows Audacity to load the waveform of the track into the editor.

### **Step 4: Export as MP3**

Backup the file so that you still have the whole song available for use later. Go to File > Export > Export as MP3\. Audacity will export the track in the original file format. If it was a WAV audio file, the export will be to that type. This ensures that the audio artifacts are kept in the best condition for editing. Be sure to name the exported file in something you will easily remember.
