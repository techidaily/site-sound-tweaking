### Audio Editor: [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) (Free)

This editor handles uncompressed audio and supports many files, including AIFF, .WAV, MP2/3.FLAC and .OGG. You can record from different inputs, employ the JACK Audio feature, monitor the volume, and add several different effects.

The good news is that this editing software is simple, straightforward, and will work for many consumers who create their own broadcasts. However, it is rather limited when recording audio from your computer itself, and you’ll need to add SoundFlower to accomplish that.

### Audio Editor:[WavePad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/) ($50)

This is one of the more celebrated audio editing software systems for Mac computers. It contains many tools and sound effects and supports a considerable number of file types. The main attribute may be how user-friendly the wavepad sound editor is and the number of different features.

The only substantial negative is that the floating toolbars used will get in the way when you are working on larger projects. However, a big positive is that this editing system can clean up old, hissy audio quite well, substantially improving your recordings.

![wavepad audio editor mac ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wavepad.jpg)

### Audio Editor:[](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/)[Sound Forge Pro Mac 2](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/prd/home.aspx) ($99)

Sound Forge is an almost legendary audio editing system used by professionals and now priced for consumers. Sound for those who want the ultimate file compatibility, features, and overall quality, Sound Forge sets the standards. The 2.0 version is perfect for sound design projects as many different audio files can be used.

The only real negative is the price itself which will push it beyond the needs of many consumers looking for a simple, straightforward audio editor Mac system. However, if you plan on growing your current projects into something more professional and expansive, then the relatively low price of the Sound Forge Pro Mac 2 should be considered.

Finding the best audio editor Mac software should start with their own particular needs and then find the product that allows them to accomplish their goals.
