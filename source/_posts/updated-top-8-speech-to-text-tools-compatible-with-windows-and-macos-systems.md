### 8\. [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)

The Ableton Live 10 Suite is a dynamic and comprehensive program for the creation and performance of musical recordings.

An essential feature of this software is that it allows you to work on your time-based workflow without affecting the live session. This means that the software gives you a rare chance to get involved with the workflow without stopping live performance.

The Multitrack Recording Technology of Ableton Live10 Suite allows music producers to adjust the speed and pacing of any audio during the recording. To make these adjustments, you don't have to pause the recording. This is one of the striking characteristics which makes this product a good option for all.

## Conclusion

If you make music on a computer, the most important resource in your artistic arsenal is your DAW; in your home recording system, you 're probably going to have the MIDI keyboard, audio interface, studio monitor speakers, and maybe a microphone or two. But your program is at the core of it all. Not everyone can afford expensive DAWs, but one must not worry as free music production software are present to aid us.

It is important to have a DAW with which you are pleased and, perhaps more importantly, a DAW, which allows you to turn your ideas into music as quickly and painlessly as possible. So make sure you choose the best one for you according to your needs. Hopefully, this guide will aid you!
