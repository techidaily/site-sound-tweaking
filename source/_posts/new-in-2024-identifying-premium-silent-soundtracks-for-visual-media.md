![ how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster.jpg)

1. #### **Use a VPN**

The best and the most effective way to get unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want is to use a VPN. VPN helps you access Omegle from a totally different location, making you a different individual to use Omegle. It masks your IP address and provides you with a virtual and temporary IP address to get access to Omegle. But there is a small disadvantage of using VPN, which is slow speed. If you plan to have video chats, this slow connection may hinder this process and get you to ban again for several drops. But you can simply refresh the VPN and access Omegle from a different location and get unbanned again.

1. #### **Wait for some time**

1. #### **Use Proxy Service**

It is no different than a VPN. It allows you to access the websites from an intermediary IP address making it your temporary IP address. This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn't encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.

1. #### **Use a Different Network**

Since the ban is not applied to the user, the IP address can simply be bypassed by changing the network you are using to access Omegle. Every network provides you with a different and Unique IP address. This could be anything, a mobile network, friend's wifi, or public wifi. Changing the network can enable you to access Omegle immediately. Once your device is connected to a new network, your device is assigned to a new IP address making the Omegle access right away.
