To add them to the video, you can simply drag them to the timeline and drop them in place. This makes it easy to pin down the start and end points for the audio tracks. The bonus here is you can use multiple sound effects overlaid.

Filmora also offers the option of detaching audio from the video. This means you can save it separately and use it on other creative projects.

The audio can also be spruced up with audio effects like “Fade-in” “Fade-out.”, You can adjust the speed and volume of the audio as well. To remove the sound effect, simply select the audio and press delete.
