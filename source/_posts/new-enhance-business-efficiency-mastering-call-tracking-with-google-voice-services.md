* [**Part 2: Free Music Production Software for Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Free Music Production Software Online**](#part3)

## Part 1: Free Music Production Software for Windows

### 1\. Audacity

The system for music development is not complete without an audio editor. Audacity is the best free music creation software available on the market. Audacity is open-source and extensive and provides a wide range of tools and effects for performing all audio editing and recording activities. It is created by a community of volunteers and provides regular notifications almost every month. It's lightweight, safe, and intuitive enough to be used by novice music makers.

**Pros**

* It is open-source
* It can load VST plugins

**Cons**

* Only 32-bit plugins are allowed
* Limited features

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Audacity-Audio-Editor-Online.jpg)

### 2\. Ardour

Ardour is a highly integrated program of music production that allows users to record and edit on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Ardour Music Production Software was created by integrating the efforts of the world's skilled team, such as recording technicians, programmers, and musicians. Such experienced technicians make their concerted and thorough efforts to build the program. Ardour is one of the few applications in music production that respects honesty. The accessibility of this program allows app developers to concentrate on functionality that matters to consumers rather than to construct compelling apps for advertising purposes. This is a system that should be celebrated for its user-focused functionality.

**Pros**

* It has excellent user-friendliness
* It is available on Mac, Linux, and Windows

**Cons**

* It lacks a few integral features
* It is difficult to operate for people new to audio editing

![Ardour](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ardour.JPG)

### 3\. Tracktion T7

The people at Tracktion seem to have reached a reasonably canny business model by launching older DAW versions for free and without anything removed.

The convention appears to make it possible to access the edition without charge of two iterations before the new one. You will not be provided with all new functionality, but you will receive an update every time the company updates its flagship DAW, which it does nearly every year.

The growing section is adjustable to match the workflow, and the bottom panel adjusts so that any parameters anywhere on the screen can be seen.

**Pros**

* It features an unlimited number of audio and MIDI tracks
* It is able to host multiple plugin formats

**Cons**

* It doesn't provide all the features at once
* It does not support many plugins

![Tracktion T7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/tracktion.JPG)

### 4\. LMMS
