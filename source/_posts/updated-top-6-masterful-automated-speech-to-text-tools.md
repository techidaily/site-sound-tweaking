Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.

* [**Part 1: Best iOS DAW for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best iOS DAW for iPhone**](#part2)

## Part 1：Best iOS DAW for iPad

Without further ado, let’s start with the best iOS DAWs for iPads.

### 1\. [GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad)

**Price:** Free with optional pay-to-add features

[GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad) is a high-quality DAW that allows you to use the Audio Unit (AU) standard. You can edit, enhance, distort, add an echo, and even a reverb, all through this one platform. GarageBand is the best iOS DAW for iPad if you happen to be a beginner. It does lack some of the finesse of the more significant, more professional systems.

**Features:**

* Apple sound and loop library is packed with choice and easily accessible.
* Can use it to download plugins from other people.
* Easy to follow for beginners, lets you edit 24-bit recordings.

### 2\. [Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519)

**Price**: $23.99

[Cubasis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cubasis-2/id583976519) is an app by Stienberg which features multiple sound sequencing and some other cool features. It comes in Cubasis, Cubasis Le (the compact version), and the updated Cubasis 2 and 3\. This is considered the best iOS DAW for iPad because it is designed to be quick and easy to use.

**Features:**

* You can use it as a multitrack recorder with hardware like RME’s FireFace UCX.
* Newest version works with both iPad and iPhone.
* Full mixer with level meters, zooms, multi-layer audio, and rearrangeable inserts.

![Cubasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/cubasis-phone.JPG)

**Price:** $13.99

[FL Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619) is filled with heavy synths like Sakura and Harmless.

It applies numerous optional plugins and VSTs, which make it ideal for beginners. They specialize in making it all fairly easy to understand, even for new users.

**Features:**
