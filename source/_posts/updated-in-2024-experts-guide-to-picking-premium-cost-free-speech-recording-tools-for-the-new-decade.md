There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

### 1\. [Google App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US)

On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.

Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

And don't worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.

### 2\. [Shazam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android)

Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds. You will get to find and listen to your desired song and get all related information like lyrics, videos, and artist's profile.

Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant).

You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.

Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 5\. [Genius – Song Lyrics & More](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US)

Genius is more of a lyrics finder app than a song identifier app for Android. Its database contains lyrics of more than 1.7 million songs, and that database is entirely crowdsourced. Besides lyrics, you will get authentic information regarding the backstory of the songs on the database.

You can stream MusiXmatch on television via Chromecast, and the app is available on all Android wearable devices. A premium version of this app allows you to view lyrics offline, removes advertisements from the app, and enables a party mode where themes play in sync with the song lyrics.

**Conclusion**

The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.

Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).

To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.

To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.

## Ideas to Create a Funny Comedy Video or Vlog

Are you a funny person and want to create videos for your YouTube channel? If yes, then here are some ideas that you can try:

### 1\. Create a Comedy Skit

Many popular YouTube content creators create comedy skits to entertain their audience. These videos include humorous content and funny dialogues. To create a comedy skit you should have a center of the story, dialogues, characters, and comedy background music.

The major time that you will spend is gathering the ideas and creating a script. This requires brainstorming and at least one funny guy in your team. For inspiration, you can notice people around you and use them as inspiration.

### 2\. Things You Can Do with Everyday Household Items

Not specifically the eggs, but videos where people use regular items in unusual ways are sometimes funny. These videos will look funny when you include comedy background music. Some ideas of these types of videos are using eggs for various tasks other than cooking.

While creating these videos you can add funny elements like fixing a tile with the egg. These types of content are random, so it makes people laugh. And don’t forget comedy background music plays an essential role to make these videos funny.

### 3\. Visit a Park with Your Dog

Dogs are funny, especially when you take them to the place they like. When you will take your dog to the park and make vlogs about the journey, people will love it. While making vlogs you can record some exciting actions performed by your dog and upload them online. If you are thinking about how these clips will make your audience laugh, then the answer is simple, comedy background music.

### 4\. Make Reaction Videos

Reaction videos that you might have seen might not be funny. But, some content creators make funny reaction videos. They react to funny videos and use comedy background music to make the content engaging.

### 5\. Film a Prank

Prank videos are the most popular comedy videos on YouTube. In these videos, one or more people prank another person while the audience watching the video already knows. Many people who are fond of prank videos love the final reactions. If you want to create prank videos, you can add comedy background music for more fun.
