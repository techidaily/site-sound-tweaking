## Part 1\. How to Separate/Detach/Split Audio from Video in iMovie on Mac

The iMovie program is capable of producing high-quality movies and videos. If you're dealing with a video that includes both sound and pictures, you may want to split the two at some point.

#### Step 1\. Remove the audio clip from the video

In your iMovie timeline, find the clip that contains both video and audio.

Right-click the clip or hold **Control** and click it. You can also go to the menu bar and choose **Detach Audio**.

The audio from that clip will then show as its own "clip" in green below the video. The little line on the left, however, confirms that the video and audio are still connected. This implies that if you delete the video, you'll lose the audio as well. As a result, you'll either need to move the audio clip somewhere else in your video or place it in the Background Music Well at the bottom of the timeline.

Simply select, drag, and drop the green audio clip where you want it. It will be in the background of all other noises in your movie if you set it in the Background Music Well.

#### Step 2\. Get rid of the video

You can remove the video by clicking it and utilizing one of these techniques after you disconnect the audio and unlink it from the video.

Select **Delete** from the shortcut menu by right-clicking.

Or hold **Control** while clicking and selecting **Delete**.

To enter the editing mode, run the software and select the 16:9 or 4:3 ratio that best suits your demands. Then select **Import** to import video clips, audio, or photographs from your computer's file folder.

It's worth noting that this tool is highly compatible with a variety of formats, allowing you to edit them frame by frame while maintaining the original quality. Drag and drop videos onto the timeline after they've been imported. All files in the timeline are combined without any gaps by default.

#### Step 2\. Separate the audio and video with a single click

Select "Detach Audio" from the context menu of the video file from which you wish to extract the audio track. You'll see an audio file appearing on the audio track right away. Yes, this is the source video's actual audio file.

## Part 3\. FAQs about Separating Audio from Video in iMovie

To learn more about separating audio from video in iMovie, you can check the FAQs below.

#### 1\. Is it possible to split audio and video in iMovie?

Yes, you certainly can. Select the video clip you want to separate after you've imported it into iMovie. Select "Detach Audio" from the context menu by right-clicking. You can now remove one of the tracks (audio or video), relocate it to a different location in the movie timeline, or alter it.

#### 2\. In iMovie, what does "detach audio" do?

The video clip's audio is deleted, and an audio-only clip (with a green bar) is inserted below the video clip. The audio clip can now be linked to any other clip in your movie, or it can be relocated to the background music section.

#### 3\. How can I remove the original audio (from the camera) and lock the new audio to the video so that I don't have to deal with two different parts (video and audio) when editing?

Make a movie in iMovie that simply mixes all the audio and visuals. You can align the video by listening to it or looking at the waveforms. After it's all lined up, go into the clip inspector and turn off the video track's volume. To maintain as much quality as feasible, SHARE/EXPORT using QuickTime and choose Apple Intermediate Codec as your codec. This will link the secondary audio and video tracks together. Now, into an Event, import the movie you just made in iMovie. You may now combine audio and video editing.

#### 4\. Is it feasible to simply take the video's audio and save it as a sound file?

If you have other clips in the timeline, you can detach the audio and copy and paste it around, but if you want all the audio from a clip or set of clips, put them in a project and make a custom QT export and export "Sound to AIFF file". Drag that into another movie clip or import it as an audio track in iTunes.

#### 5\. How do I get the audio from the clip to detach so that I may remove it and record fresh audio over it?

Only in the project timeline, not in the event pane, can you disconnect audio from a clip.

#### 6\. In iMovie for Mac, how can I mute a video?

Click the **Create New** button in iMovie to start a new project. From the resulting dropdown menu, pick **Movie**. Select the video you wish to mute by clicking the **Import Media** option. Drag and drop the video onto the timeline once it's been imported. Right-click on the video in the timeline and choose **Detach Audio** from the dropdown menu.
