## "Melody Compendium: The 15 Best Music Selections for Different Visual Media Types"

Montage is a film editing technique that combines a series of clips or shots into a single sequence. Background music is often applied to the final montage during compilation. We'll look at some of the best montage music for different video types and the benefits of adding them to your montage video.

## Why Music Is Important for Montage Video

Music plays an essential role in montage videos. Here are five reasons why you should add music to your montage video.

#### 1\. Music Captures Attention

One of the reasons people include music in montage videos is that it holds the audience's attention; it shapes emotion while motivating viewers. In addition to touching viewers, music makes the moving images in your montage video seem more beautiful and engaging. It also brings mood and dynamism to the video.

Musicologists have discovered that the choice of musical instruments, volume, harmony, and tempo play a vital role in montage video.

#### 2\. Music Takes Your Montage Video to the Next Level

By using music, you'll boost the cohesiveness and production value of your montage video. Your audience wants a professional montage video that is well-constructed and flows nicely. Music is the bridge that lets your montage video transition seamlessly between different scenes or ideas, particularly when you need to have a jump cut.

Additionally, montage music is a great way to fill in moments in your montage video that would have been silent. You can also use it to fill dead air in your video where there is a visual without sound.

#### 3\. Music Helps You to Communicate Your Message

Music is a vital component in conveying your message in your montage video. The music in your video should be in tune with the message you are trying to send.

#### 4\. Helps to Underscore the Unfolding Action

Montage music helps you to emphasize the action taking place in your video. As a result, this will make your audience focus on the action and get your message.

#### 5\. Helps You Create Rhythm for Your Montage Video

Music allows you to create a rhythm for scenes and clips in your montage video. A good rhythm can hold up your entire montage video.

## 15 Best Montage Music for Different Video Types

A good montage music track syncs to the beat of the video, and the song plays right on each shot. Keeping this in mind, here are 15 of the best montage music for different video types.

### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

To use the music tracks on your mix or videos, export them without vocals. Go to Filе/Export/Filе to еxport a filе. Thе audio format for thе nеw music filе you can sеlеct rangеs from MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF and many othеrs.

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

![click discrimination](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-8.jpg)

### Step 5\. Apply the Effect

On the Effects Rack panel, click Apply at the bottom of the effect window. Your audio file's length may determine the amount of time it takes Adobe Audition to apply the effects.

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

To use the music tracks on your mix or videos, export them without vocals. Go to Filе/Export/Filе to еxport a filе. Thе audio format for thе nеw music filе you can sеlеct rangеs from MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF and many othеrs.

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.

A Tip for Enhancing Results

To get perfect results, I recommend always listening back while you adjust these sliders, since audio quality varies from one to another.
