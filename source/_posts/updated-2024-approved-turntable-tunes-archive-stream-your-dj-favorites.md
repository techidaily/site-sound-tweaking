AMR is an abbreviation for Adaptive Multi-Rate Audio Codec. It is a technology that utilizes audio compression formats primarily for speech. A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb/s to 12.2 kb/s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format.
